The monogamous system that already existed in Swaziland was repealed by the Marriage Act 47 of 1964 with a view to bringing about integration of Swazi customary law into Roman-Dutch common law. The creation of monogamous marriage without the provision of any security to the wife against the excesses of the husband as he enjoys under customary law, will be empty legislation. The stability of marriage is necessary for stability in society, because of the importance of the family in society. The two systems of marriage, marriage under the Act and marriage under the Swazi customary law, are not mutually destructive and stand side by side. Law, which is supposed to solve social problems, has created problems of a permanent nature between the parties rather than giving them social repose.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the data science and remote sensing communities have started to align due to user-friendly programming tools, access to high-end consumer computing power, and the availability of free satellite data. In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70\%) and evaluation (30\%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar's chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 {\textpm} 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 {\textpm} 0.017), random forests (0.739 {\textpm} 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 {\textpm} 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar's test results showed that 62\% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5\% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25\%) and shortwave infrared (23\%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38\%) and summer (40\%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified. The article concludes with recommendations for future research.},

Given that the relationship is highly simultaneous in nature, we use exogenous variation in geographic features to construct an instrument for spatial inequality, which is independent from any man-made factors. Our instruments are inequality measures based on grid-level data for existing countries as well as for artificial countries. In the construction of the instrumental variable, we use both a parametric regression analysis as well as a random forest classification algorithm. Our IV regressions show a significant negative relationship between spatial inequality and economic activity. This result holds if we control for country-level averages of different geographic variables. Therefore, we conclude that geographic heterogeneity is an important determinant of economic activity.},

  abstract = {Green regeneration has become a common strategy for improving quality of life in disadvantaged neighborhoods in shrinking cities. The role and function of new green spaces may change, however, when cities experience new growth. Set against this context, this paper analyzes a case study, the Lene-Voigt-Park in Leipzig, which was established on a former brownfield site. Using a combination of methods which include an analysis of housing advertisements and interviews, the paper explores the changing role of the park in the context of urban regeneration after the city's turn from shrinkage towards new growth. It discusses whether the concept of green gentrification may help to explain this role. As a result of our analysis, we argue that Lene-Voigt-Park has indeed operated as a trigger for structural, social, and symbolic upgrades in the growing city of Leipzig, but only in combination with real estate market developments, which are the main drivers of change. The concept of green gentrification does help to better understand the role of different factors---first and foremost that of green space. We also discovered some specifics of our case that may enrich the green gentrification debate. Leipzig serves as an example for a number of regrowing cities across Europe where green gentrification might represent a challenge.},

The methodological approach comprised two main parts: Firstly, a literature review of main reports, legislation, and scientific articles was conducted at the intersection of `gerontology and physical exercise' with `urban design and mobility', leading to the selection of four aging-related studies as main contributors to the design of the WIEH; and, secondly, the development of the WIEH was undertaken, based on two premises and designed according to four steps. The first premise defined three systematic areas (urban tissue, urban scene, and safety), variables, and criteria to classify the pedestrian network; and the second premise focused on slopes and stairs in public spaces. The WIEH is divided in four steps: (1) Analyzing public spaces and characterizing their quality for walking, (2) considering the existence of slopes and stairs, (3) calculating different routes for the elderly in their daily routines, or when going to points of interest, and (4) selecting the ``heart-friendly route'' for elderly people. Adequate walking paths for the elderly can be identified through this innovative approach, with the aim of achieving direct health benefits during their daily routines. Ultimately, the WIEH is capable of supporting decision makers and designers in creating inclusive and age-friendly spaces.},

Sources of data for digital health tools include multiple modalities such as electronic medical records (EMR), radiology images, and genetic repositories, to name a few. While historically, these data were utilized in silos, new machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies enable the integration of these data sources to produce multi-modal insights. Data fusion, which integrates data from multiple modalities using ML and DL techniques, has been of growing interest in its application to medicine. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art research that focuses on how the latest techniques in data fusion are providing scientific and clinical insights specific to the field of cardiovascular medicine. With these new data fusion capabilities, clinicians and researchers alike will advance the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) to deliver more timely, accurate, and precise patient care.},

The study found that high income neighbourhoods have the lowest overall provision of pedestrian space and protection from traffic (in more urbanized areas) and the lowest walking accessibility to people, shops, and leisure areas (in less urbanized areas). Low income neighbourhoods have the highest environmental risks (in more urbanized areas) and the highest slopes, lowest provision of formal pedestrian space, and lowest accessibility to jobs, facilities, and bus stops (in less urbanized areas). The results provide insights into the type of public policies needed to improve walkability in the different parts of the city.},

However, while pedestrians engage with the street environment, walkability assessments often overlook human-scale characteristics, focusing mainly on the neighborhood-level. Furthermore, traditional studies on walkability rely on limited and time-bound methods. To address these research gaps and obtain insights into the connection between walking and the built environment, this study utilizes machine learning techniques to scrutinize mobile-app data on pedestrian traffic alongside street characteristics. Tree-based algorithms are deployed to identify the association between walking volume and built environment features at the street-level, spanning distinct time periods. The pedestrian traffic data was gathered in Tel Aviv, Israel, while accounting for seasonal variations, weekdays, and time of day. Examining 20 streetlevel characteristics across 8000 segments furnishes new insights into the relative significance of various characteristics for walking, as well as street profiles linked to greater vs. lesser pedestrian activity. Notably, time variables emerge as crucial, with street features varying in importance across different time definitions. The study offers implications for decision-makers and urban planners by informing them of pedestrians' behaviors and preferences at the street-level, facilitating more efficient infrastructure investments and supporting planning decisions.},

In particular, walking emerges as a central topic. Walking, in fact, is conceptualized as a vector for engaging with the world, and as a conduit to physical activity, social contact and optional practices. Consequently, a vast body of literature exists, related to the concept of walkability. The latter can be defined as the built environment potential to affect people's propensity to walk to different destinations and for different purposes. This study, through a comprehensive literature review investigates four concepts: capability; affordance; configuration and Urban ethics. These concepts embody four central dimensions of the research on walkability: arguments for investigating walkability; conceptualization of person-environment transactions; methodologies and ethical implications. The aim of this study, thus, is to individuate the theoretical framework for a precise understanding of the impact of the built environment on human behaviour and to underline perspectives for the further development of the research on walkability.},

Our investigation shows that although the neighborhoods present very different physical and morphological characteristics, most of their walkability levels are low. The overall T-WSI value is equal to 46.65/100, with a wide variability between districts (from 28.90/100 to 68.28/100). The calculation of the T-WSI shows that the problems and critical issues are similar between districts, independent of their sizes, and they refer mainly to the same categories and indicators. In general, the results relating to both the safety (e.g., protection from vehicles, road lighting, etc.) and urbanity (e.g., road equipment) of districts are very deficient.},

  abstract = {Urban systems present hierarchical structures at many different scales. These are observed as administrative regional delimitations which are the outcome of complex geographical, political and historical processes which leave almost indelible footprints on infrastructure such as the street network. In this work, we uncover a set of hierarchies in Britain at different scales using percolation theory on the street network and on its intersections which are the primary points of interaction and urban agglomeration. At the larger scales, the observed hierarchical structures can be interpreted as regional fractures of Britain, observed in various forms, from natural boundaries, such as National Parks, to regional divisions based on social class and wealth such as the well-known North--South divide. At smaller scales, cities are generated through recursive percolations on each of the emerging regional clusters. We examine the evolution of the morphology of the system as a whole, by measuring the fractal dimension of the clusters at each distance threshold in the percolation. We observe that this reaches a maximum plateau at a specific distance. The clusters defined at this distance threshold are in excellent correspondence with the boundaries of cities recovered from satellite images, and from previous methods using population density.},

We develop a framework to consistently define cities, using commuting to work and population density thresholds, and construct thousands of realizations of systems of cities with different boundaries for England and Wales. These serve as a laboratory for the scaling analysis of a large set of urban indicators. The analysis shows that population size alone does not provide us enough information to describe or predict the state of a city as previously proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not corroborated. We found that most urban indicators scale linearly with city size, regardless of the definition of the urban boundaries. However, when nonlinear correlations are present, the exponent fluctuates considerably.},

  abstract = {Walking is the most sustainable form of transportation. It is the socially equitable, economically viable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. However, transportation technology has caused the desertion of the pedestrian space due to excessively motorized transport. Consequently, the pedestrian environment has degraded. In many cities, the abandonment of the pedestrian space has created a socially unfriendly environment. Walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is to walk. In measuring walkability, several criteria are considered, which include inter alia, the quality of pedestrian facilities, roadway conditions, land use patterns, community support, security and comfort for walking. Findings from studies are mixed; some stated that improving the built environment does not encourage people to walk more; however, there are other studies that indicated otherwise. The aim of this paper is to review the built environment characteristics that promote walking. A literature review of studies that focused on walking, walkability, the built environment, pedestrian and urban design was conducted. This study has searched the electronic databases that intertwined with the Web of Science database. The choice was made due to the comprehensiveness of quality academic studies indexed in the database, thus providing reliable sources of body of work. The database integrates numerous sub-databases such as Web of Science Core Collection, Derwent Innovations Index, KCI Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index and SciELO Citation Index. The data are then thematically coded. The fields of urban planning, urban design, geography, transportation, sociology, and other related areas were included in the research. The result of this review offers evidence to the criteria that promote walking. The review found that three criteria are somewhat constant in promoting walking, namely, population and building density, land use and land use mixes, and safety. In short, by making an area perceived as safe with the presence of land use mixes and density are the best combination to create a walkable environment.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating and disproportionate impact on the elderly population. As the virus has swept through the world, already vulnerable elderly populations worldwide have faced a far greater burden of deaths and severe disease, crippling isolation, widespread societal stigma, and wide-ranging practical difficulties in maintaining access to basic health care and social services -- all of which have had significant detrimental effects on their mental and physical wellbeing. In this paper, we present an overview of aging and COVID-19 from the interrelated perspectives of underlying biological mechanisms, physical manifestations, societal aspects, and health services related to the excess risk observed among the elderly population. We conclude that to tackle future pandemics in an efficient manner, it is essential to reform national health systems and response strategies from an age perspective. As the global population continues to age, elderly-focused health services should be integrated into the global health systems and global strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries with historically underfunded public health infrastructure and insufficient gerontological care.},

  abstract = {Unaffordable housing costs are one of the most pressing issues facing our cities, affecting people's health in difficult to measure ways. People's health varies over time and dynamically interacts with experiences of housing. Longitudinal analyses rarely explicitly model these variations. Quantile regression is an underutilised tool for testing associations across the distribution of an outcome. In this paper we apply panel quantile regression to test whether cumulative exposure to unaffordable housing over time has differential impact on mental health, dependent on initial health status. Using an annual longitudinal sample of 20,906 urban Australians (2001--2016), we model mental health outcomes using quantile regression (accounting for being in 10th, 50th, 90th mental health percentile initially). Although traditional fixed-effects models find weak evidence of cumulative effect, quantile regression reveals that individuals with low-median initial mental health were more affected by unaffordable housing, and individuals with high initial mental health appeared to be protected. Our findings suggest quantile regression as a promising method for understanding complex human effects of urban problems, and that policies targeted toward people with the poorest mental health may mitigate the consequences of exposure to unaffordable housing.},

Approaches to make cities more resilient to floods are emerging, notably with the design of flood-resilient structures, but relatively little is known about the role of urban form and its complexity in the concentration of flooding. We leverage statistical mechanics to reduce the complexity of urban flooding and develop a mean-flow theory that relates flood hazards to urban form characterized by the ground slope, urban porosity, and the Mermin order parameter which measures symmetry in building arrangements. The mean-flow theory presents a dimensionless flood depth that scales linearly with the urban porosity and the order parameter, with different scaling for disordered square- and hexagon-like forms. A universal scaling is obtained by introducing an effective mean chord length representative of the unobstructed downslope travel distance for flood water, yielding an analytical model for neighborhood-scale flood hazards globally. The proposed mean-flow theory is applied to probe city-to-city variations in flood hazards, and shows promising results linking recorded flood losses to urban form and observed rainfall extremes.},

In this context, particular attention should be paid to the analysis of walkability. It has been proved that performing walking activities produces significant benefits both for physical and mental health, above all in elderly subjects. Besides traditional criteria adopted to evaluate walkability, we here propose a novel approach defined affective walkability. Being able to interpret the emotions of elderly walking in the urban environment and interacting with vehicles and other citizens, it is possible to evaluate if and to which extent an environment is perceived safe, comfortable and walkable. One way to obtain quantitative measures of walkability is to assess safety perception relying on physiological signals that can be considered indicators of emotions and mood. The assessment of affective walkability requires the design and performance of rigorous experiments to properly collect data. In this paper, the proposal of an affective walkability is presented and the developed experimental protocols, their performance and preliminary results are illustrated.},

  abstract = {Urban sprawl and increasing population density in urban centers create the challenge to finding ways of sustainable transportation solutions that preserve the convenience of residents while reducing emissions. Therefore, walkability is a core urban design element because of being advantageous onto three fronts: health, livability, and sustainability. Adopting walkability as urban solution relieves conceptual and practical tensions between the individualistic interests manifested in the desire to own and use private cars, and the need to reduce transportation-based consumption. This review advocates that long-term health benefits from walking and physical activity are the premier incentive to repurpose our cities to be more sustainable and more walking friendly, and spark behavioral change into reducing car dependency for all daily transportations. The review inspects physical elements of the built environment that make the walking trip feasible and desirable, such as connectivity, accessibility, and closeness of destination points, presence of greenness and parks, commercial retail, and proximity to transit hubs and stations. Hence, this review explores a few popular walkability evaluation indices and frameworks that employ subjective, objective, and/or distinctive methods within variant environmental, cultural, and national context. There is no unified universal standardized walkability theory despite the need for rigorous evaluation tools for policy makers and developers. Furthermore, there is a lack of emphasis on air quality and thermal stress while approaching walkability, despite being important elements in the walking experience. Research opportunities in the field of walkability can leverage location tracking from smart devices and identify the interaction patterns of pedestrians with other transportation modes, especially for those with fundamental movement challenges such as wheelchair users.},

Regrettably, this strong assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, where sensors are prone to failure or can face adverse conditions (night-time, rain, fog, etc.) that make the acquired information unreliable. Moreover, these architectures tend to fail in continual learning scenarios. In this work, we re-frame the task of multimodal semantic segmentation by enforcing a tightly-coupled feature representation and a symmetric information-sharing scheme, which allows our approach to work even when one of the input modalities is missing. This makes our model reliable even in safetycritical settings, as is the case of autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, comparing it with our closest competitor. We also introduce an ad-hoc continual learning scheme and show results in a class-incremental continual learning scenario that prove the effectiveness of the approach also in this setting.},

Urban vegetation provides numerous ecosystem services on a local scale and is therefore a potential adaptation strategy that can be used in an era of global warming to offset the increasing impacts of human activity on urban environments. In this study, we propose a set of urban green ecological metrics that can be used to evaluate urban green ecosystem services. The metrics were derived from two complementary surveys: a traditional remote sensing survey of multispectral images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and a survey using proximate sensing through images made available by the Google Street View database. In accordance with previous studies, two classes of metrics were calculated: greenery at lower and higher elevations than building facades. In the last phase of the work, the metrics were applied to city blocks, and a spatially constrained clustering methodology was employed. Homogeneous areas were identified in relation to the urban greenery characteristics. The proposed methodology represents the development of a geographic information system that can be used by public administrators and urban green designers to create and maintain urban public forests.},

However, the influence of the built environment (BE) on pedestrians' perceptions of the walking environment has not been fully understood. To address this gap, the present research investigates how BE characteristics of a suburban walking environment are associated with the perceptions of attractiveness (i.e., pleasantness, friendliness), safety, and security. Using a cross-sectional design, 995 participants reported their perceptions about the attractiveness, safety, and security of different suburban BE scenarios in Brisbane (Australia). Univariate and bivariate random effect ordered probit models were estimated to identify the associations between BE characteristics and perceived attractiveness, safety, and security whilst controlling for psychosocial factors. Results indicated that perceived attractiveness (i.e., pleasantness and friendliness) was higher for recreational areas than residential land use. Women perceived the walking environment as more pleasant with trees. The perception of safety was higher for recreational and vacant land compared to residential areas. Young pedestrians perceived that the likelihood of being assaulted/robbed/harassed at night was lower if they walked through an area with commercial and mixed land use. Women pedestrians perceived that the corresponding risk at night was higher in recreational areas. Overall, the findings suggest that urban design strategies such as increasing land use diversity and providing adequate trees enhance perceived environmental attractiveness, safety, and security, ultimately resulting in more walking for transport.},

Globalization of city functions, which has been occurring in the last half century or longer, is destroying this stability. In the context of how populations are connected to one another in cities, urban resilience takes many forms. The local networks compose cities and act to boost their resilience to local changes and disruptions are being connected to national and international networks that are much more difficult to control and plan for, and which contain the seeds of economic disruption through contagion that spans the globe.},

There are two main quantitative dimensions of the study: to generate accessible areas to facilities and to identify age-friendly values within the identified accessibility areas. To measure age-friendliness, new index sets were created using the Age-Friendly Approach Index and the Weighted Age-Friendly Approach Index. The results underline that the most age-friendly areas of open spaces are in the districts: Fatih, Beyo{\u g}lu and {\"U}sk{\"u}dar; the most age-friendly areas of health services are in Kad{\i}k{\"o}y, {\c S}i{\c s}li, Beyo{\u g}lu, Fatih, Bayrampa{\c s}a, G{\"u}ng{\"o}ren and Bah{\c c}elievler; the most age-friendly areas of basic needs are in Fatih, Kad{\i}k{\"o}y, {\c S}i{\c s}li and Gaziosmanpa{\c s}a.

Population loss is measured in terms of prevalence, severity, and persistence and is also analyzed geographically.

Health geographers can contribute to the loneliness and ageing literature through examining how exposures in the physical and social landscape can affect positive and negative health outcomes. As well as improving individual experiences of ageing, spatial analysis may help to contribute to better understandings of loneliness and help reduce the \$1.7 billion per annum New Zealand currently spends on publiclyfunded aged residential care. Using New Zealand Home Care International Residential Assessment Instrument data from 2012 to 2016, the spatial distribution of the interRAI-HC cohort was examined. Urban and rural distribution, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity within the interRAI-HC cohort was compared against total population and population aged 65 plus. Relative to the socioeconomic status of the 65 plus cohort, those being interRAI-HC assessed were more likely to live in socially deprived areas. Socioeconomic deprivation also positively correlated with loneliness (OR = 1.002). Carer stress was negatively correlated with socioeconomic status (OR = 0.99). Those in rural areas were predicted to be less lonely than urban dwellers (OR = 0.98), and this observation remained similar and significant when socioeconomic status, the experience of negative social interactions or carer stress, and whether they lived alone were included. Living in rural areas had a protective effect against loneliness for all ethnic groups apart from Pasifika. `Hot' and `cold' clusters of loneliness were identified, with the distribution of interRAI-HC assessments in hot clusters less likely to be rural areas (OR = 0.71). Our findings did not diverge greatly from prior research on older people and loneliness in rural areas. Observations of regional differences regarding rurality and socioeconomic status did not show large differences, and this research will benefit in future from analysis at finer geographic scale.},

We used data from the Adult Changes in Thought cohort study for a cross-sectional analysis of 936 participants aged 65 to 97 years. The Walkable and Bikable Communities Project previously formulated a walkability score to predict the probability of walking in King County, Washington. Data from the cohort study were linked to the walkability score at the participant level using a geographic information system. Analyses tested for associations between walkability score and activity and body mass index., Results. Higher walkability scores were associated with significantly more walking for exercise across buffers (circular zones around each respondent's home) of varying radii (for men, odds ratio [OR]=5.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.01, 34.17 to OR=9.14; CI=1.23, 68.11; for women, OR=1.63; CI=0.94, 2.83 to OR=1.77; CI=1.03, 3.04).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between neighborhood walkability and depression in older adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from Adult Changes in Thought (ACT), a prospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred forty randomly selected men and women aged 65 and older, cognitively intact, living in the same home for at least 2 years. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The Walkable and Bikable Communities Project provided objective data predicting the probability of walking at least 150 minutes per week in a particular neighborhood. ACT data were linked at the individual level via a geographic information system to this walkability score using buffer radii of 100, 500, and 1,000 meters around the subject's home. Multiple regression analysis tests were conducted for associations between the buffer-specific neighborhood walkability score and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: There was a significant association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in men when adjusted for individual-level factors of income, physical activity, education, smoking status, living alone, age, ethnicity, and chronic disease. The odds ratio for the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) of walkability score was 0.31 to 0.33 for the buffer radii (P=.02), indicating a protective association with neighborhood walkability. This association was not significant in women. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in older men. Further research on the effects of neighborhood walkability may inform community-level mental health treatment and focus depression screening in less-walkable areas.},

  abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, {$\beta$}, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have {$\beta$} {$\approx$}1.2 {$>$}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display {$\beta$} {$\approx$}0.8 {$<$}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which {$\beta<$}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

Analysis of the routes selected by a purposive sample of independently mobile adults aged 65 years and over living in Edinburgh, UK, revealed a preference to walk in more walkable environments, alongside a willingness to walk in less supportive settings.

  abstract = {Problem: When the First National Conference on City Planning took place in Washington, DC, 100 ago, the delegates failed to foresee the consequences of automobility and suburbanization, but in other ways they were remarkably prescient. They stressed the importance of the linkage between transportation and land use, understood that transportation facilities must be harmoniously embedded in the urban fabric, and viewed transportation investment as a way to direct growth, revitalize flagging areas, and link jobs and housing. Since transportation planners in subsequent decades kept this vision alive, envisioning a network of context-sensitive urban freeways fully integrated into the urban milieu, why is this not what was built? Purpose: We consider the history of U.S. urban transportation planning over the past 100 years, to explain the evolution and legacy of the single most important transportation development of the past century save automobility itself: the emergence of the urban freeway. Methods: We reviewed primary and secondary material, including plans, manuscripts, newspaper accounts, and scholarly articles and books. Results and conclusions: We argue that the method used to fund interstate highway development put federal and state highway engineers in charge, and this affected highways' location and design. State highway engineers imposed a narrow, traffic-service-oriented vision on metropolitan freeways that focused on maximizing vehicle throughput and largely ignored other urban concerns. With too little advance thought, overbuilt, sparse, ring-radial networks were routed through neighborhoods in cities around the country, often at great social and environmental cost. Though the system has undeniably conferred great benefits in terms of enhanced mobility, the costs have been high as well. Recent years have seen a return to the early planners' perspective, stressing the social, environmental, and aesthetic impacts of transportation facilities and interactions with land use. Takeaway for practice: A century-old vision of coordinated transportation and land use planning has resurfaced in practice, but in the meantime politically expedient decisions about public finance have had unanticipated, but profound and long-lasting effects on projects, travel, and urban form. Research support: Portions of this research were funded by the University of California Transportation Center and the University of California, Los Angeles Academic Senate.},

  abstract = {Physical inactivity is one of the most important public health issues in the U.S. and internationally. Increasingly, links are being identified between various elements of the physical--- or built--- environment and physical activity. To understand the impact of the built environment on physical activity, the development of high-quality measures is essential. Three categories of built environment data are being used: (1) perceived measures obtained by telephone interview or self-administered questionnaires; (2) observational measures obtained using systematic observational methods (audits); and (3) archival data sets that are often layered and analyzed with GIS. This review provides a critical assessment of these three types of built-environment measures relevant to the study of physical activity. Among perceived measures, 19 questionnaires were reviewed, ranging in length from 7 to 68 questions. Twenty audit tools were reviewed that cover community environments (i.e., neighborhoods, cities), parks, and trails. For GIS-derived measures, more than 50 studies were reviewed. A large degree of variability was found in the operationalization of common GIS measures, which include population density, land-use mix, access to recreational facilities, and street pattern. This first comprehensive examination of built-environment measures demonstrates considerable progress over the past decade, showing diverse environmental variables available that use multiple modes of assessment. Most can be considered first-generation measures, so further development is needed. In particular, further research is needed to improve the technical quality of measures, understand the relevance to various population groups, and understand the utility of measures for science and public health.},

In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering `black boxes' where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for \$\$n\$\$\,=\,all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

  abstract = {Vision-based object detection and scene understanding are becoming key features of environment perception and autonomous driving. In the past couple of years, numerous large-scale datasets for visual object detection and semantic understanding have been released which has enormously benefited the environment perception in self-driving cars. However, these datasets like Kitti and Cityscapes only focus on well organized and urban road traffic scenarios of European countries while ignoring the dense and unpattern traffic conditions of subcontinent countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Consequently, the environment perception system developed on these datasets cannot efficiently assist self-driving cars in traffic scenarios of subcontinent countries. To this end, we present CARL-D, a large-scale dataset and benchmark suite for develop 2D object detection and instance/pixel-level segmentation methods for self-driving cars. CARL-D comprises largescale stereo vision-based driving videos captured from more than 100 cities of Pakistan, including motorways, dense and unpattern traffic scenarios of urban, rural, and hilly areas. As a benchmark selection, 15,000 suitable images are labeled for 2D object detection and recognition. Whereas semantic segmentation benchmark contains 2500 images with pixel-level high-quality fine annotations and 5000 coarse-annotated images which could help in enabling the deep neural networks to leverage the weakly labeled data. Alongside the dataset, we also present transfer learning-based 2D vehicle detection and scene segmentation methods to evaluate the performance of existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks on our dataset. Lastly, an extensive experimental evaluation along with the comparative study has been carried out which demonstrates the upper edge of our dataset in terms of interclass-diversity, scene-variability, and annotations richness. The proposed benchmark suite is available at https://carl-dataset.github.io/index/.},

There is also a need to extend the gentrification debate beyond the Anglo-American context, while understanding the urban implications of contemporary demographic processes. In response to such challenges we examine the changing population geographies of the city of Bologna, with the aim of establishing, whether the concept of `reurbanisation' can provide a more useful encapsulation of its recent sociospatial transformations. Upon investigating the spatial patterns and movements of relevant population structures at various scales within the city, we have found that Bologna is the site of multifaceted and multidirectional demographic trends. In their entirety, these dynamics are leading to the social diversification, `residentialisation', and fragmentation of the urban fabric. Such processes cannot be subsumed under the notion of gentrification because they do not involve major housing renovation and are spread throughout the inner city in a diffused and fragmented manner. `Reurbanisation' is a more appropriate term to describe them.},

In this paper, deep neural network-based approaches are presented to label urban land use at pixel level using high-resolution aerial images and ground-level street view images. We use a deep neural network to extract semantic features from sparsely distributed street view images and interpolate them in the spatial domain to match the spatial resolution of the aerial images, which are then fused together through a deep neural network for classifying land use categories. Our methods are tested on a large publicly available aerial and street view images dataset of New York City, and the results show that using aerial images alone can achieve relatively high classification accuracy, the ground-level street view images contain useful information for urban land use classification, and fusing street image features with aerial images can improve classification accuracy. Moreover, we present experimental studies to show that street view images add more values when the resolutions of the aerial images are lower, and we also present case studies to illustrate how street view images provide useful auxiliary information to aerial images to boost performances.},

In this letter, we propose a new method, called self-attention-based deep feature fusion (SAFF), to aggregate deep layer features and emphasize the weights of the complex objects of remote sensing scene images for remote sensing scene classification. First, the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model is applied to extract the abstract multilayer feature maps from the original aerial imagery. Then, a nonparametric self-attention layer is proposed for spatial-wise and channel-wise weightings, which enhances the effects of the spatial responses of the representative objects and uses the infrequently occurring features more sufficiently. Thus, it can extract more discriminative features. Finally, the aggregated features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The proposed method is experimented on several data sets, and the results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme for remote sensing scene classification.},

It has not yet been determined whether Walk Score relates to other critical components of the physical activity environment, including street connectivity, access to public transit, residential density, and crime. Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between Walk Score and objective/subjective measures of the physical activity environment. Methods Walk Scores were calculated for residential addresses of 296 participants of two RCTs (2006--2009). Street connectivity, residential density, access to public transit provisions, and crime were objectively measured (GIS) and cross-referenced with Walk Scores and participant's perceptions of the environment (e.g., perceived crime, access to physical activity facilities, perceived neighborhood walkability). Pairwise Pearson correlations were calculated in March 2010 to compare Walk Score to subjective/objective measures of neighborhood walkability. Results Significant positive correlations were identified between Walk Score and several objective (e.g., street connectivity, residential density and access to public transit provisions) and subjective (e.g., summed score of the physical activity environment) measures of the physical activity environment. However, positive correlations also were observed between Walk Score and crime. Conclusions Collectively, these findings support Walk Score as a free, easy-to-use, and quick proxy of neighborhood density and access to nearby amenities. However, positive associations between Walk Score and reported crime highlight a limitation of Walk Score and warrant caution of its use.},

Although there is growing evidence that the neighborhood environment can influence walking for recreation, the amount of such evidence in relation to older adults is scarce and limited to Western low-density urban locations. Asian urban environments are typified by distinctive environmental and cultural characteristics that may yield different patterns to those observed in Western countries. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine associations of perceived environmental attributes with overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation in Chinese elders (65+~years) residing in Hong Kong, an ultradense Asian metropolis. A sample of 484 elders was recruited from 32 neighborhoods stratified by socio-economic status and walkability (dwelling and intersection densities). Validated questionnaires measuring perceived neighborhood environment and weekly minutes of overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation were interviewer administered. Results showed that the level of recreational walking was twice to four times higher than that reported in Western adults and elders. While overall walking for recreation showed a general lack of associations with perceived environmental attributes, within-neighborhood recreational walking was positively related with proximity of recreational facilities, infrastructure for walking, indoor places for walking, and presence of bridge/overpasses connecting to services. Age and educational attainment moderated the associations with several perceived environmental attributes with older and less-educated participants showing stronger associations. Traditional cultural views on the benefits of physical activity and the high accessibility of facilities and pedestrian infrastructure of Hong Kong may explain the high levels of walking. Although specific neighborhood attributes, or their perception, may influence recreational walking within the neighborhood, the compactness and public transport affordability of ultradense metropolises such as Hong Kong may make it easy for elders to compensate for the lack of favorable neighborhood attributes by walking outside the neighborhood.},

This assessment means a city's budget can be allocated appropriately to make sure the city makes the most of its usually limited budget. However, this assessment still relies largely on manual annotation to generate the Overall Condition Index (OCI) of a pavement stretch. Manual surveying can be inaccurate, while on the other side of the spectrum a large portion of automatic surveying techniques rely on expensive equipment (such as laser line scanners). To solve this problem, we propose an automated infrastructure assessment method that relies on street view images for its input and uses a spectrum of computer vision and pattern recognition methods to generate its assessments. We first segment the pavement surface in the natural image. After this, we operate under the assumption that only the road pavement remains, and utilize a sliding window approach using Fisher Vector encoding to detect the defects in that pavement; with labelled data, we would also be able to classify the defect type (longitudinal crack, transverse crack, alligator crack, pothole ... etc.) at this stage. A weighed contour map within these distressed regions can be used to identify exact crack and defect locations. Combining this information allows us to determine severities and locations of individual defects in the image. We use a manually annotated dataset of Google Street View images in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. We show promising results, achieving a 93\% Fl-measure on crack region detection from perspective images.},

Using both small (questionnaire survey) and big (large-scale geospatial) data, we conducted a case study in Hong Kong, a well-known vertical metropolis with a multi-modal transportation system. We analyzed mode and departure time shift behaviors in response to travel time change for 2,927 participants and examined the impacts of new variables derived from a 3D pedestrian network dataset and potential influencing factors identified in the literature. The results from the mode shift model indicated that having more efficient pedestrian networks, as measured by the total length of walkways and the provision of mobility aid facilities (e.g., travellators, escalators), is effective in promoting mode shift behaviors. Meanwhile, our departure time shift model revealed that having more comfortable walkways, as measured by travel attitude and the provision of mobility aid facilities, increases users' willingness to make departure time shifts from peak hours. These findings imply that a more efficient and comfortable walking environment facilitates mode and departure time shift behaviors in daily travel. Improving the building and management of walking environments would contribute to a more integrated multi-modal transport system.},

  abstract = {The walkability of destinations plays a decisive role in obtaining a sense of place for urban visitors. For an improved walkability-based visit experience, the city structure can be analyzed by dividing it into small units, starting with the destination. However, existing studies focus on the walkability of residents by administrative district and use limited contextual information and structural analysis tools. Therefore, this study aims to structurally understand walkability through network analysis with mobile-based visitor data collected from 822 point-of-interest (POI) in Daejeon. In this study, the actual walking distance between 95,817 cells with visitors and POIs was measured to calculate the edge weight and influence of cells on POI. We analyzed the POI-cell network through edge weight and extracted nine communities to understand the city context through POI analysis and derived the following findings. First, it is possible to determine the potential demand by visitors' walkability-based division. Second, our walkability measurement method follows a bottom-up approach, starting with a small unit cell, understanding the entire city as a community extraction model, and possibly extending to other cities in Korea. Third, POI-centered structural analysis is possible using the number of visitors and distance in the proposed network analysis method.},

The gravity model was used to calculate the urban park accessibility for every housing estate using different transportation modes (walking, bus, mass transit railway). Google Maps API real-time travel data were used to estimate a series of regression models. We found that public transportation reduced travel time to urban parks for all residents, while it significantly increased the spatial inequality of urban park accessibility between public and private housing residents. We concluded that the spatial inequality of public park accessibility between public and private housing residents in Hong Kong did not owe to the spatial distribution of the urban parks or of the residential locations. The evidence suggested that the spatial inequality was largely attributable to differences in the accessibility and connectivity of public transportation between public housing estates and urban parks.},

However, scant attention has been paid to population-level walking behaviors, such as pedestrian volume, because of the difficulty of collecting such data. We propose a new approach to extract citywide pedestrian volume using readily available street view images and machine learning technique. This innovative method has superior efficiency and geographic reach. In addition, we explore the associations between the extracted pedestrian volume and both macro- and micro-scale built environment characteristics. The results show that micro-scale characteristics, such as the street-level greenery, open sky, and sidewalk, are positively associated with pedestrian volume. Macro-scale characteristics, operationalized using the 5Ds framework including density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance to transit, are also associated with pedestrian volume. Hence, to stimulate population-level walking behaviors, policymakers and urban planners should focus on the built environment intervetions at both the micro and macroscale.},

During this time, research interests have demonstrated a shift from the development of GEOBIA theoretical foundations to advanced geo-object-based models and their implementation in a wide variety of real-world applications. We suggest that such a rapid GEOBIA evolution warrants the need for a systematic review that defines the recent developments in this field. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to elucidate the emerging trends in GEOBIA and discuss potential opportunities for future development. The emerging trends were found in multiple subfields of GEOBIA, including data sources, image segmentation, object-based feature extraction, and geo-object-based modeling frameworks. It is our view that understanding the state-of-the-art in GEOBIA will further facilitate and support the study of geographic entities and phenomena at multiple scales with effective incorporation of semantics, informing high-quality project design, and improving geo-object-based model performance and results.},

This phenomenon can occur not only in cities with growing populations, but also in those with shrinking populations. Today, many cities around the world are continuously shrinking due to population decline. However, there is still a lack of information on urban forms and the distribution of UGSs. Therefore, this study analyzes the relationship between urban form and UGS equity in shrinking cities by mapping and measuring urban form indicators and UGS equity indicators in 147 shrinking cities in seven regions of Japan for the first time. The results show that 1) partial Japanese urban shrinkage affects equitable development of UGSs; 2) cities with compact populations facilitate equitable urban development; 3) the shape and continuity of urban patches affect the distribution of UGSs in shrinking cities in all regions; 4) urban size, centrality, compactness of urban patches, and urban patch fragmentation affect the distribution of UGSs in shrinking cities in local regions. The results of this study can provide city managers with reliable urban development strategies to promote equitable distribution of UGSs in shrinking cities.},

  abstract = {China is on the brink of transitioning into an aged society, resulting in a growing demand for an age-friendly street-built environment. However, previous research has paid limited attention to the differentiated walking needs of older adults. To address this gap, this study investigated the relationship between street-built environments and the subjective perception of older adults with different physical capabilities, focusing on safety, comfort, and interest. The older adults were classified into three types based on their physical mobility abilities. The TrueSkill algorithm was used to develop an online image selection website to obtain perception scores for sampled pictures from these three types of older adults. Image segmentation and deep learning were combined to extract indices of street view factors, and machine learning was used to train a scoring prediction model for all streetscape pictures of the area. The study found differences in the subjective perception among all three types of older adults, namely independent elderly (A), mediated-assisted elderly (B), and dependent elderly (C). Type A older adults might be attracted to factors related to the interest of walking despite their negative impact on safety and comfort; Type B older adults were more concerned about street conditions for safety and comfort. Type C older adults were prone to the convenience of barrier-free access and visibility. This study contributes to the study of walkability by providing a research framework for the subjective walking perceptions of older adults with different physical capabilities. Additionally, the visualized walkability map can serve as a reference for architects and urban designers, further strengthening the development of age-friendly communities with the aid of human-centric computational analysis, evaluation, and design.},

One of the key strategies to contain the pandemic is mass vaccination programme. However, vaccination rates vary across space and socio-economic factors, and are likely to depend on the accessibility to vaccination services. There is a lack of quantitative understanding of how spatial-socio-economic factors influence the Covid-19 vaccination rates in England. Methods  We investigated the percentage of over-18 fully vaccinated people at the small-area level across England up to 18 November 2021. We used (multiscale) geographically weighted regression to model the spatially heterogeneous relationship between vaccination rates and socio-economic determinants, including ethnic, age, economic, and accessibility factors. Results  This study indicates that the selected model can explain 83.2\% of the total variance of vaccination rates. The variables exhibiting a positive association with vaccination rates in most areas include proportion of population over 40, car ownership, average household income, and accessibility to vaccination. In contrast, population under 40, low multiple deprivation level, and black or mixed ethnicity are negatively associated with the vaccination rates. Conclusions  Our findings indicate the importance of improving the spatial accessibility to vaccinations in developing regions and among specific population groups in order to promote Covid-19 vaccination.},

  abstract = {China has been witnessing prominent demographic ageing because of its sustained low fertility (one-child policy) and mortality rates. In 2017, nearly one in four elderly adults in the world live in China. The rapid increase of the elderly population is supposed to dramatically influence the urban and transportation system. Active travel plays an important role for the ageing Chinese population to sustain their mobility and wellbeing. To provide suitable policy implications for age-friendly travel environments in China, this study investigates how the built environment affects active travel behavior. Particularly, we explore the influences of built environment on daily active travel frequency and time expenditure while taking into account travel attitudes. A zero-inflated ordered probit model and a Cox proportional hazards model are respectively estimated based on the Nanjing Travel Survey data. Results show that the social and cultural contexts exert pronounced impacts on the travel pattern of Chinese older people. Specifically, it is found that the living pattern of co-residence, and the proximity to market, park/square, and chess/card room are influential in shaping active travel patterns. In addition, the built environment shows larger effects on the active travel behavior of older adults than on that of young people. Attitudes towards active travel are not significant in explaining the senior's travel behavior, indicating limited self-selection effects. The findings will offer insights to establish effective and appropriate land use strategies and public facility distribution for the elderly during the Chinese urban renewal process.},

Geographical access to urban amenities is known to influence social participation and integration. However, the application of accessibility analysis to elderly population in China has received little attention to date. This study examines the walking accessibility to recreational amenities for older adults in the Chinese context with an explicit focus on equity. Building on empirically-based estimates of a cumulative opportunity approach, we calculate the levels of accessibility at the traffic analysis zone level, evaluate how accessibility varies across age cohorts, and present the distribution of accessibility across zones. To this end, we draw on the 2015 Nanjing Travel Survey and the city's GIS database. Instead of assuming a fixed threshold, this paper applies a spatial expansion model to allow for person- and location-specific walking distances to measure accessibility. The spatial disparities in access to recreational amenities are evaluated using the notion of vertical equity for identifying areas that are better-off or worse-off. Our results show pronounced distributional effects of current land-use and transportation policies for different age cohorts. In particular, elderly people experience lower accessibility to chess/card rooms and urban parks than their younger counterparts. The empirical evidence in this research can inform planning and policy interventions and feed current scientific debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social inclusion for an age-friendly society.},

How can we reconcile such contradictory arguments? This research note aims to use a difference-in-differences model to empirically disentangle the moderating effect of Airbnb on the relationship between crime and house prices. Using the housing transaction data in the two census years of the Auckland Region, New Zealand, we demonstrate that the impact of crime on house prices is contingent on the density of Airbnb. After controlling neighbourhood qualities, such as household incomes, ethnicity concentration and proportion of public housing in each census tract, the effect of crime rate on house prices is negatively moderated by the number of Airbnb listings, especially in apartment-type housing. The result can be interpreted as showing the effects of trespassing-related crime on house prices.},

Recent studies have used Google Street View as an instrument to assess city streets and walkable environments; however, no study has compared the validity of Google Street View assessments of walkable environment attributes to assessments made by local residents and compiled from field visits. In this study, we involved nearby residents and compared the extent to which Google Street View assessments of the walkable environment correlated with assessments from local residents and with field visits. We determined the assessment approaches (local resident or field visit assessments) that exhibited the highest agreement with Google Street View. One city with relatively high-quality walkable environments and one city with relatively low-quality walkable environments were examined, and three neighborhoods from each city were surveyed. Participants in each neighborhood used one of three approaches to assess the walkability of the environment: 15 local residents assessed the environment using a map, 15 participants made a field visit to assess the environment, and 15 participants used Google Street View to assess the environment, yielding a total of 90 valid samples for the two cities. Findings revealed that the three approaches to assessing neighborhood walkability were highly correlated for traffic safety, aesthetics, sidewalk quality, and physical barriers. Compared with assessments from participants making field visits, assessments by local residents were more highly correlated with Google Street View assessments. Google Street View provides a more convenient, low-cost, efficient, and safe approach to assess neighborhood walkability. The results of this study may facilitate future large-scale walkable environment surveys, effectively reduce expenses, and improve survey efficiency.},

Safe strategy use is an important component of falls prevention, yet little is known regarding use of outdoor falls prevention strategies.AimsTo examine outdoor falls prevention strategy use among naturally occurring retirement community residents at risk for falls, and to examine associations with neighborhood walkability.MethodsDescriptive analyses of pretest data from an intervention study (N = 97) were conducted to examine frequency of outdoor falls prevention strategy use. Walk Score{\textregistered} data were added to the dataset, and chi-square tests of independence were used to examine associations between walkability categories and outdoor falls prevention strategy use.ResultsSome strategies, such as visual scanning and holding rails on stairs, were used by 70\% or more of participants while others, such as route planning, were infrequently or inconsistently used. With the exception of avoiding cell phone use while walking outdoors, no significant associations were found between walkability categories and outdoor falls prevention strategy use.ConclusionStudy findings serve as a needs assessment for health education and behavioral training.},

Of all remotely sensed data, those acquired by Landsat sensors have played the most pivotal role in spatial and temporal scaling. Modern terrestrial ecology relies on remote sensing for modeling biogeochemical cycles and for characterizing land cover, vegetation biophysical attributes, forest structure, and fragmentation in relation to biodiversity. Given the more than 30-year record of Landsat data, mapping land and vegetation cover change and using the derived surfaces in ecological models is becoming commonplace. In this article, we summarize this large body of work, highlighting the unique role of Landsat.},

Participants were 324 community-dwelling persons aged 74 -- 85 years who completed a health questionnaire that included items on exercise preferences as well as questions on demographic variables, health, and exercise habits. Selected participants then completed a physical performance battery to measure lower body functioning. Results. A physician's advice to exercise, monitoring by a health professional, an evaluation of the exercise program by a professional, and the quality of the instructor were all rated as important or very important by at least 70\% of the participants. Several other factors such as easy access to exercise facilities, type of exercise performed, free or low cost of a program, and other participants being of the same age were rated as slightly important or important. Preferences were related to participants' health and demographic characteristics. For example, participants who were not married were more interested in the social aspects of exercise programs, and those with higher levels of education and more resources were less concerned with program costs. Conclusions. The findings suggest that exercise programs should be tailored to meet the needs and wishes of subgroups of this population. In order to motivate at-risk elderly persons to exercise, programs must take these varying preferences into account and explore their meaning for program design.},

Models represent a middle ground between the singular configurations of cities and universal theories. This is what makes them valuable and prone to circulate (between places, institutions and languages) and evolve to adapt to new ideas, local conditions and/or other models. When it comes to analytical urban models (i.e. analytical representations of cities developed to study or simulate part of their structure or dynamics), there is a lack of academic understanding regarding how context and circulation affect their content, use and interpretation. What happens to analytical urban models and their reception during their circulation across geographical and disciplinary boundaries? How have different academic disciplines interacted with, contributed to and been influenced by analytical urban models? What are the consequences of urban models' mobility for our understanding of cities? In this article, we employ the policy mobilities framework to analyse the circulation of analytical urban models. We use six canonical models as case studies to determine how their assumptions came about and how these models have circulated across different domains of policy and application by using biographical information and model analysis. The first contribution of the article is to demonstrate by example that our hypothesis regarding the influence of context is consistent. We also show that highly transferable/mobile models share common characteristics relating to contingent factors such as their creators' biographies, institutional context and the traditional markers of power relations.},

Yet social and mobile datasets have limitations that, if not sufficiently understood and accounted for, can produce specific kinds of analytical and ethical oversights. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems that emerge from the reliance on particular forms of crisis data, and we suggest ways forward through a deeper engagement with ethical frameworks and a more critical questioning of what crisis data actually represents. In particular, the use of Twitter data and crowdsourced text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake raised questions about the ways in which crisis data act as a system of knowledge. We analyze these events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical perspectives and assess the challenges of data collection, analysis and deployment. While privacy concerns are often dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms such as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information shared during a crisis---often as a way to find assistance and support---present ongoing risks. We argue for a deeper integration of critical data studies into crisis research, and for researchers to acknowledge their role in shaping norms of privacy and consent in data use.},

Remote sensing is one of the most frequently used tools to assess pelagic Sargassum distribution. The purpose of this study was to implement a methodological approach to detect floating algae in an efficient and replicable manner at a moderate cost. We analyzed Landsat 8 imagery, from which we calculated four vegetation indices and one floating-algae index to implement a supervised classification, together with the bands 2 and 5, using the Random Forest algorithm. The analysis was performed monthly from 2014 to 2015 for the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with a total of 91 analyzed images. The quantitative performance metrics of the classifier (overall, Kappa and Tau) were greater than 80\%, whereas bands 2 and 5 as well as the atmospherically resistant vegetation index made the greatest contributions to the classifications. During summer 2015, more than 4,000 ha of Sargassum coverage per image were observed, which was substantially greater than that over the rest of the period. This approach constitutes a transferable alternative for the systematic detection of Sargassum, which enables a quantitative semi-automated time series comparison.},

Studies assessing physical activity or overall health of a community-based population were included if underlying theoretical models and concepts were applicable to a senior population. Studies solely assessing social or psychosocial characteristics of place were excluded, as were review articles.Data Extraction.Extracted data included theoretical model, aspect of built environment studied, methods, and outcomes.Data Synthesis.Tables present key definitions and summarize information from empirical studies.Results.Twenty-seven articles that focused on the environment-behavior relation in neighborhoods, six specific to seniors, were found.

This study characterised leisure time physical activity in older Australians ({$\geq$}65 years), examining the diversity in reported activities Design: Cross-sectional monitoring. Methods: The Exercise Recreation and Sport Surveys (2001--2009) were combined and analysed for 22,050 elderly. Results: Walking was reported by 45.6\%, of those 53\% engaged exclusively in walking. Prevalent sports (i.e., {$>$}1\%) were bowls (9.4\%), aerobics/callisthenics exercise (9.1\%), golf (7.7\%), swimming (6.4\%), gym work (5.2\%), cycling (3.2\%), tennis (2.9\%), dancing (2.1\%), fishing (2.0\%), tai chi (1.4\%), weight lifting (1.2\%) and yoga (1.1\%). Significant gender differences were apparent. Over time, significant increases were reported in walking, aerobic/callisthenics and gym workout in both genders. In the previous year, 32.0\% of older adults participated in ``nil'' activity, 40.6\% engaged in one activity, 19.5\% and 8.0\% participated in two or three or more activities, respectively. Common combinations were walking with another aerobic activity. Only 2.6\% reported a combination of aerobic, balance and strength activities. Multiple-activity participation increased over the years, but declined with increasing age, education and for the most disadvantaged, compared to single-activity participation. Partially or exclusively organised participation, combined, was reported by 42.5\% of older adults. Women were more likely to combine mode of participation. Geographic region was associated with multiple-activity participation and organised-only participation. Conclusions: Most elderly people engage in one activity, if at all.

  abstract = {Parks are an important place for residents to relax. An equitable distribution of parks can promote social equity and enhance the residents' welfare. The service areas of parks are affected by the mode of transport. As public transport is a green and economic travel mode with a wide range of applications, we identified the service area of parks based on the accessibility of public transport. On this basis, the problem of park layout was analyzed. The results show that: (1) the coverage rate for the park service areas decreased from the center of Beijing to the periphery. The subdistricts around employment districts have a high coverage of park services, whereas some suburban subdistricts lack services. (2) The spatial form of PSAs can be affected by factors such as railways, water courses, and the topography, so there are service gaps for some 48 parks, which are mainly located outside the Fourth Ring Road area. (3) A poor allocation of public transport resources has aggravated the uneven distribution of the park services. Areas with few parks also have poor public transportation conditions.},

  abstract = {Walking is the most accessible form for seniors to engage in daily light or moderate physical activity. Walking activity depends on both individual and environmental factors, the latter including how walkable a given setting is. Recent papers have pointed at the relevance of also considering meteorological conditions in relation to the walking behavior of older adults. This paper explores the combined effect of neighborhood walkability, temperature and rain on daily walking time among seniors residing in Barcelona. Daily walking time was extracted from 7-day GPS (Global Positioning System) devices and accelerometer data of 227 seniors residing in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (Spain). Temperature and rain data were extracted from official governmental weather stations. Mixed-effects linear regression models were adjusted to test the combined association between weather and walkability on daily walking time. Neighborhood walkability is positively associated with walking time among seniors, while rain generally deters it. Additionally, this study demonstrates that temperature and rain modify the effect of residential walkability on senior walking activity: low temperatures are particularly associated with lower walking activity among those residing in low walkable areas, while the presence of rain presents a negative association with walking time in high walkable environments. The combined effect of walkability and weather should be considered both in design actions that aim at improving walking infrastructure and also in prevention programs aimed at encouraging daily walking among seniors.},

Although urban vacant land is a sign of economic decline, it is beneficial to the improvement of urban ecology since it provides a variety of critical ecosystem services. It is unclear how socioeconomic/ecological drivers collectively affect the emergence and dynamics of vacant land within the urban context of population decrease and economic decline in different shrinking cities. To address this issue, this research performed comprehensive analyses to examine and quantify the impacts of social processes, economic conditions, urban ecological and spatial proximity factors on residential vacant land at both the block group level and the parcel level through incorporating high spatial resolution multispectral aerial photographs and GIS datasets. Results indicate three major conclusions. First, the mean lot NDVI is found to be a consistently effective measurement of residential landscape management behaviors at both levels, which is significantly and positively related to residential vacancy. Second, proximity factors indirectly and partially characterize a number of socioeconomic variables. Third, a ratio index called neighborhood vacancy prevalence was proposed to capture the neighborhood blight effect, and a potentially optimal neighborhood size was obtained among different neighborhood radii. By considering different categories of variables, residential vacancy can be explained and modeled adequately at both the aggregate and fine levels. Urban planners, geographers and social scientists could benefit from the explanatory and predictive model at the fine scale to yield the most updated parcel data with acceptable estimation accuracy for various practical applications.},

  abstract = {For decades, accessibility -- i.e. the ease of reaching destinations --has been an important concept in transport planning, resulting in many studies trying to measure it and put it into practice. Also walkability, a mode-specific type of accessibility referring to how easy it is to walk (to destinations) received increased attention in the last two decades. In recent years, a new focus has been on how people perceive their accessibility as this may be a stronger predictor of travel behaviour than objective elements of accessibility (such as built environment characteristics). Perceived walkability, i.e. how walk-friendly people experience a certain area, however, has only been explored by a limited number of studies. In this review paper, we give an overview of existing studies analysing perceived walkability, which mostly have focused on its effects on walking frequency/duration, physical activity and various aspects of mental well-being. Based on this literature review, a conceptual model is created, emphasising the determinants and effects of perceived walkability and how it is related to objective walkability. We end this paper by providing avenues for further research, including the introduction of a Short Perceived Walkability Scale (SPWS) and recommendations for data collection and analysis. Doing so can create new insights into perceived walkability and links with related elements, and therefore can contribute to stimulating walking trips and improving the experience of these trips.},

However, little research has been done on the quality of the green area, as well as on quantity and quality of smaller natural elements in the streetscape. This study investigates the link between the objectively assessed quantity and quality of (1) green areas and (2) streetscape greenery on the one hand and three self-reported health indicators on the other. Methods 80 Dutch urban neighbourhoods were selected, varying in the amount of nearby green area per dwelling, as determined by Geographic Information System analysis. The quality of green areas, as well as the quantity and quality of streetscape greenery, was assessed by observers using an audit tool. Residents of each neighbourhood were asked to complete a questionnaire on their own health (N=1641). In multilevel regression analyses, we examined the relationship between greenspace indicators and three health indicators, controlling for socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results Both indicators for the quantity of greenspace were positively related to all three health indicators. Quantity and quality indicators were substantially correlated in the case of streetscape greenery. Nevertheless, the quality indicators tended to have added predictive value for the health indicators, given that the quantity information was already included in the model. Conclusions The quantity and also the quality of greenspace in one's neighbourhood seem relevant with regard to health. Furthermore, streetscape greenery is at least as strongly related to self-reported health as green areas.},

  abstract = {Urban mobility and sustainable transportation are fundamental for the European Union's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The EU encourages national governments to prioritize zero-emission urban transport systems that emphasize safety, accessibility, and inclusiveness. Promoting walking plays a fundamental role in sustainable urban mobility, offering advantages such as emission reduction, better air quality, and enhanced public health. Recent research underscores the importance of creating appealing and safe pedestrian environments to encourage walking. These efforts align with the United Nations' Agenda 2030 sustainability goals, particularly Objective 11, which aims to build inclusive, safe, and sustainable cities and communities. This paper explores the factors influencing pedestrians' willingness to walk and categorizes them into basic factors, performance factors, and excitement factors, on the basis of the three factors theory. Significantly, the study reveals that the importance of these factors varies based on demographics, mainly the age of the users. Understanding these factors and their relative significance for pedestrian satisfaction is crucial for shaping effective policies and urban planning strategies aimed at promoting sustainable mobility. By prioritizing pedestrian satisfaction and addressing the specific needs and preferences of diverse groups, cities can create more walkable and environmentally friendly urban environments. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners working toward EU climate-neutral objectives and enhancing the well-being of citizens.},

Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5--7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen's d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

  abstract = {Shrinking cities---cities suffering from population and economic decline---has become a pressing societal issue of worldwide concern. While night-time light (NTL) data have been applied as an important tool for the identification of shrinking cities, the current methods are constrained and biased by the lack of using long-term continuous NTL time series and the use of unidimensional indices. In this study, we proposed a novel method to identify and classify shrinking cities by long-term continuous NTL time series and population data, and applied the method in northeastern China (NEC) from 1996 to 2020. First, we established a long-term consistent NTL time series by applying a geographically weighted regression model to two distinct NTL datasets. Then, we generated NTL index (NI) and population index (PI) by random forest model and the slope of population data, respectively. Finally, we developed a shrinking city index (SCI), based on NI and PI to identify and classify city shrinkage. The results showed that the shrinkage pattern of NEC in 1996--2009 (stage 1) and 2010--2020 (stage 2) was quite different. From stage 1 to stage 2, the shrinkage situation worsened as the number of shrinking cities increased from 102 to 162, and the proportion of severe shrinkage increased from 9.2\% to 30.3\%. In stage 2, 85.4\% of the cities exhibited population decline, and 15.7\% of the cities displayed an NTL decrease, suggesting that the changes in NTL and population were not synchronized. Our proposed method provides a robust and long-term characterization of city shrinkage and is beneficial to provide valuable information for sustainable urban planning and decision-making.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science'' programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

Density, functional mix and access networks are well-recognised as key factors: density concentrates more people and places within walkable distances; functional mix produces a greater range of walkable destinations; and access networks mediate flows of traffic between them. This complex synergy of density, mix and access -- herein called the urban DMA -- largely stems from the work of Jacobs.

Any reduction to a singular index of morphological properties can involve a misrecognition of how cities work. We argue that walkability is a complex and somewhat nebulous set of capacities embodied in any urban morphology, and that it should not be conflated with nor derived from actual levels of walking.城市``步行性''的概念在一系列多学科领域的纽带中占据了关键地位，这些领域将城市设计和规划与更广泛的公共卫生、气候变化、经济生产力和社会公平等问题联系起来。然而，可步行性的概念本身仍然难以捉摸------难以定义或作。密度、功能组合和接入网络是公认的关键因素：密度使更多的人和地方集中在步行距离内;功能组合产生了更多适合步行的目的地;接入网络调节它们之间的流量。这种密度、混合和可及性的复杂协同作用------这里称为城市 DMA------主要源于 Jacobs 的工作。通过基于组合思维的方法，我们表明这些因素中的每一个都是多重的，并且难以定义或衡量。任何简化为形态特性的单一指数都可能涉及对城市运作方式的误解。我们认为，步行能力是一组复杂且有些模糊的能力，体现在任何城市形态中，它不应该与实际的步行水平混为一谈，也不应从实际的步行水平中得出。},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automated classification system of landform elements based on object-oriented image analysis. First, several data layers are produced from Digital Terrain Models (DTM): elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature and slope gradient. Second, relatively homogenous objects are delineated at several levels through image segmentation. These object primatives are classified as landform elements using a relative classification model, built both on the surface shape and on the altitudinal position of objects. So far, slope aspect was not used in classification. The classification has nine classes: peaks and toe slopes (defined by the altitudinal position or the degree of dominance), steep slopes and flat/gentle slopes (defined by slope gradients), shoulders and negative contacts (defined by profile curvatures), head slopes, side slopes and nose slopes (defined by plan curvatures). Classes are defined using flexible fuzzy membership functions. Results are visually analyzed by draping them over DTMs. Specific fuzzy classification options were used to obtain an assessment of output accuracy. Two implementations of the methodology are compared using (1) Romanian datasets and (2) Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. The methodology has proven to be reproducible; readily adaptable for diverse landscapes and datasets; and useful in respect to providing additional information for geomorphological and landscape studies. A major advantage of this new methodology is its transferability, given that it uses only relative values and relative positions to neighboring objects. The methodology introduced in this paper can be used for almost any application where relationships between topographic features and other components of landscapes are to be assessed.},

  abstract = {The applications of object-based image analysis (OBIA) in remote sensing studies of wetlands have been growing over recent decades, addressing tasks from detection and delineation of wetland bodies to comprehensive analyses of within-wetland cover types and their change. Compared to pixel-based approaches, OBIA offers several important benefits to wetland analyses related to smoothing of the local noise, incorporating meaningful  non-spectral features for class separation and accounting for landscape hierarchy of wetland ecosystem organization and structure. However, there has been little discussion on whether unique challenges of wetland environments can be uniformly addressed by OBIA across different types of data, spatial scales and research objectives, and to what extent technical and conceptual aspects of this framework may themselves present challenges in a complex wetland setting. This review presents a synthesis of 73 studies that applied OBIA to different types of remote sensing data, spatial scale and research objectives. It summarizes the progress and scope of OBIA uses in wetlands, key benefits of this approach, factors related to accuracy and uncertainty in its applications and the main research needs and directions to expand the OBIA capacity in the future wetland studies. Growing demands for higher-accuracy wetland characterization at both regional and local scales together with advances in very high resolution remote sensing and novel tasks in wetland restoration monitoring will likely continue active exploration of the OBIA potential in these diverse and complex environments.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood walkability can influence physical activity. We evaluated the validity of Walk Score{\textregistered} for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5--11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p {$<$} 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score{\textregistered} is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score{\textregistered} is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Over two decades after the scholarly interventions that coalesced into `critical GIS' as a field within GIScience, critical GIS remains underdeveloped in conversations on teaching and learning. The literature on GIScience education has emphasized content more than pedagogies -- what to teach versus how to teach to move students toward particular learning objectives. This emphasis is reflected in dominant curricular approaches to critical GIS, in which questions around the complicated origins and complicit social, political, and economic relationships of GIS are taken up as discrete topics, tacked onto instruction that otherwise prioritizes technical dimensions of GIScience. We argue that GIScience coursework must resist such modularization by approaching critical GIS not as a set of topics, but an orientation to GIS praxis that `does' GIS from within a questioning stance, to ask how we know. We outline specific curricular shifts and teaching practices we have used to foster this orientation in GIS students, offering ways of continually engaging students in practicing this orientation as they learn strong technical GIScience content. Finally, we trace the successes, challenges, and tensions sparked by these critical GIS pedagogies, drawing on student evaluation comments from our courses and reflecting on broader implications for GIScience instructors and geography faculty.},

  abstract = {Background The occurrence of outdoor activity limitation (OAL) among older adults is influenced by multidimensional and confounding factors associated with aging. Aim The aim of this study was to apply interpretable machine learning (ML) to develop models for multidimensional aging constraints on OAL and identify the most predictive constraints and dimensions across multidimensional aging data. Methods This study involved 6794 community-dwelling participants older than 65 from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Predictors included related to six dimensions: sociodemographics, health condition, physical capacity, neurological manifestation, daily living habits and abilities, and environmental conditions. Multidimensional interpretable machine learning models were assembled for model construction and analysis. Results The multidimensional model demonstrated the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.918) compared to the six sub-dimensional models. Among the six dimensions, physical capacity had the most remarkable prediction (AUC: physical capacity: 0.895, daily habits and abilities: 0.828, physical health: 0.826, neurological performance: 0.789, sociodemographic: 0.773, and environment condition: 0.623). The top-ranked predictors were SPPB score, lifting ability, leg strength, free kneeling, laundry mode, self-rated health, age, attitude toward outdoor recreation, standing time on one foot with eyes open, and fear of falling. Discussion Reversible and variable factors, which are higher in the set of high-contribution constraints, should be prioritized as the main contributing group in terms of interventions. Conclusion The integration of potentially reversible factors, such as neurological performance in addition to physical function into ML models, yields a more accurate assessment of OAL risk, which provides insights for targeted, sequential interventions for older adults with OAL.},

For people such as senior citizens, public transport needs to be accessible and affordable in order to provide them with the opportunity to fulfil their medical, shopping and recreational needs. Providing access to transport for people with age 65 \& over is not a marginal problem and it is expected to grow in the future. The most important concern in accessibility is the relatively short distance and high frequency movements from a permanent home. This study will identify the travel pattern \& mode for elderly commuters in greater Melbourne, Australia. The study will also suggest strategies to improve the use of public transport system to promote ageing in place.},

  abstract = {Benefiting from prompt tuning, recent years have witnessed the promising performance of pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, on versatile downstream tasks. In this paper, we focus on a particular setting of learning adaptive prompts on the fly for each test sample from an unseen new domain, which is known as test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Existing TPT methods typically rely on data augmentation and confidence selection. However, conventional data augmentation techniques, e.g., random resized crops, suffers from the lack of data diversity, while entropy-based confidence selection alone is not sufficient to guarantee prediction fidelity. To address these issues, we propose a novel TPT method, named DiffTPT, which leverages pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse and informative new data. Specifically, we incorporate augmented data by both conventional method and pre-trained stable diffusion to exploit their respective merits, improving the models ability to adapt to unknown new test data. Moreover, to ensure the prediction fidelity of generated data, we introduce a cosine similarity-based filtration technique to select the generated data with higher similarity to the single test sample. Our experiments on test datasets with distribution shifts and unseen categories demonstrate that DiffTPT improves the zero-shot accuracy by an average of 5.13{\textbackslash}\% compared to the state-of-the-art TPT method. Our code and models will be publicly released.},

  abstract = {From a disaster relief perspective, an immediate and efficient rescue operation after an earthquake can greatly increase the number of survivors. An effective rescue operation depends on two key elements: localisation of the affected areas and estimation of the number of casualties in these areas. Many more studies have been conducted on the localisation of affected areas than on casualty estimation. Consequently, this study develops a model for rapidly estimating the number of casualties using satellite remote sensing (SRS). The model is based on the attributes of damaged buildings, as these buildings cause the greatest harm to inhabitants and they can be detected by SRS. The model uses the damage index (DI) of buildings computed by a numerical damage model derived from SRS images to assess the extent of damage. The DI is then combined with the building's materials and structure index, which is calculated using information from the local geographic information system, to compute the joint casualty index (JCI). Finally, the number of casualties is estimated by the product of the JCI multiplied by the number of people inside the damaged buildings at the time of the earthquake. The model is then applied to three towns in Dujiangyan City, as these were the areas that most severely affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Preliminary results showed that there was little difference between the actual and estimated number of casualties. It is recommended that more casualty data should be included in the model to improve the accuracy of estimation.},

Most of the existing research has focused on the influence of socio-demographics and built environments, while the impact of socio-cultural backgrounds has attracted less attention. Regarding the influence of built environments, previous studies have mainly focused on general elements such as density, and land use mixture, while specifics about how built environments influence the elderly have largely been ignored. This paper, therefore, attempts to investigate how socio-cultural settings, interacting with built environments, affect the travel behavior of the elderly in urban China. Particularly, we will examine the impacts of a set of built environment attributes on daily activity participation and the travel distance of the elderly in Nanjing. Based on quantitative and qualitative data, we found that special social and cultural contexts make the travel pattern of Chinese elderly and the determinants of that pattern different from those of their western counterparts. Specifically, it was found that public transportation accessibility instead of auto transportation accessibility, vegetable markets instead of supermarkets and convenience stores, open spaces and parks along with chess and card rooms instead of gyms and sports centers are more decisive in affecting the travel behavior of the elderly. These findings offer insights for policy making on distributing appropriate public facilities for the elderly in urban areas, especially in new towns in urban China.},

Despite the interest raised by the concept, and other variants of chrono-urbanism, to date, only a few studies have evaluated cities from the FMC perspective. Most studies on the subject also lack a proper well-defined methodology that can properly assess FMC conditions. In this context, this study contributes to the development of an appropriate FMC-measuring method by using network analysis for services and activities in the City of Barcelona (Catalonia, northeastern Spain). By using network analyst and basing our analysis on cadastral parcels, this study is able to detail the overall accessibility conditions of the city and its urban social functions based on the FMC perspective. The resulting spatial synthetic index is enhanced with the creation of partial indexes measuring the impact of education, provisioning, entertainment, public and non-motorized transport, and care facilities. The results show that most residents of this dense and compact city live in areas with proximity to services, that can clearly be labeled as FMC, although there are some shortfalls in peripheral areas. Results validate the FMC methodology as a viable method to highlight spatial inequalities at the microscale level, a valuable tool for the development of effective planning policies.},

Some discussions focus on environmental features or means of making walkable environments, including areas being traversable, compact, physically enticing and safe. Others deal with outcomes potentially fostered by such environments, such as making places lively, enhancing sustainable transportation options and inducing exercise. Finally some use the term walkability as a proxy for better design whether composed of multiple, measurable dimensions or providing a holistic solution to urban problems. This review both problematizes the idea of walkability and proposes a conceptual framework distinguishing these definitions. This matters for urban design, because what is considered a walkable place varies substantially between definitions leading to substantially different designs. By mapping the range of definitions, this review highlights potential conflicts been forms of walkability.},

Objective To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant's home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Methods Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household's physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults. Results Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was significant (p =0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the {$\geq$}30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18\% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (confidence interval=1.18--4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended {$\geq$}30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day. Conclusions This research supports the hypothesis that community design is significantly associated with moderate levels of physical activity. These results support the rationale for the development of policy that promotes increased levels of land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density as interventions that can have lasting public health benefits.},

  abstract = {Background: Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated empirically at the individual level. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between the built environment around each participant's place of residence and self-reported travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity classifications. Methods: Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked, age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential density, and street connectivity were developed within a 1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related activity when adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity. The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was conducted in 2004. Results: Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2), with each quartile increase being associated with a 12.2\% reduction in the likelihood of obesity across gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6\% increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8\% reduction in the likelihood of obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were stronger among white than black cohorts. Conclusions: Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity, yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time in a car can be effective as health interventions.},

  abstract = {Land use change, in the form of urbanization, is one of the most significant forms of global change, and most cities are experiencing a rapid increase in population and infrastructure growth. However, a subset of cities is experiencing a decline in population, which often manifests in the abandonment of residential structures. These vacant and abandoned structures pose a land use challenge to urban planners, and a key question has been how to manage these properties. Often times land use management of these structures takes the form of demolition, but the elimination of infrastructures and can have unknown and sometimes unintended effects on the humaneenvironment interactions in urban areas. This paper examines the association between demolitions and crime, a humaneenvironment interaction that is fostered by vacant and abandoned properties, through a comparative statistical analysis. A cluster analysis is performed to identify high and low hot spots of demolition and crime activity, specifically assault, drug arrests, and prostitution, over a 5-year period. Results show that there is an association between the area targeted for significant demolition activity and the migration of spatial patterns of certain crimes. The direction of crime movement toward the edges of the city limits and in the direction of the first ring suburbs highlights the importance of regional planning when implementing land use policies for smart decline in shrinking cities.},

  abstract = {Urban parks, as important carrier of outdoor physical activity, can effectively reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and promote public health. The accessibility of parks directly affects residents' levels of physical activity. However, current accessibility assessments do not consider physical activity needs into account and are unable to adapt to the current developmental needs of a healthy China. We propose a framework for evaluating park accessibility oriented towards a physical activity service perspective. First, we introduced a park attractiveness index based on physical activity preferences. The index encompasses not only objective park features but also subjective environmental perception features, which are evaluated using deep-learning techniques. Furthermore, the size of the park catchment area was correlated with the park attractiveness index, and the likelihood of park selection based on people's physical activity preferences was computed. Fuzhou City's Gulou District was selected for this case study. The results show the following: (1) Our proposed evaluation model can identify more underserved neighborhoods in scenarios geared toward physical activity requirements than traditional approaches. (2) The distribution of parks in the Gulou District was not sufficiently balanced, with the accessibility value at the 90th percentile only slightly higher than the average value of 6.35. There was obvious spatial differentiation, with a pattern of high values in the central area and low values in the surrounding areas. (3) Approximately 12.70 \% of the population is located within service-blind zones and the overall level of accessibility is poor. This study offers novel ideas and approaches for optimizing the spatial layout of urban parks within a health-oriented framework. This aids planners and policymakers in enhancing the spatial layout of parks and ensuring equitable access to urban parks that foster physical activity.},

This paper proposes a methodology aimed at defining a new measure of pedestrian accessibility for elderly. We first identify characteristics of the pedestrian network and built environment that may impact upon accessibility to elderly, and weight each feature using an AHP analysis. Walking behaviours are considered in terms of walking speed and travel times for elderly. Accessibility levels are derived referring to the system defined by the relationship between the characteristics of the pedestrian network, the offer of urban services and behaviours of elderly. This methodology has been tested in the urban contexts of Naples and Aberdeen. The results provide useful suggestions to decision makers in prioritising interventions to be implemented at the neighbourhood scale to improve the accessibility to urban services.},

For this segment of the population, walking represents the main means of accessing urban services and actively participating in community life. It is thus essential to improve both the physical and functional organization of urban areas to develop comfortable and safe walking paths for the elderly and the other weak segments of population. Therefore, this study provides a methodology for classifying a neighbourhood as more or less accessible for the elderly to reach urban services on the basis of its favourable characteristics. Based on the results of a literature review and Delphi analysis, the fuzzy technique was applied to evaluate the security and urban context characteristics, both in terms of the pedestrian network and built environment. The obtained weights, validated by a sensitivity analysis, were then used to calculate a walking attractiveness index for the elderly using a GIS tool. The methodology was then tested in two neighbourhoods of Naples; the outputs show the areas that local decision-makers should prioritise to improve the safety and attractiveness of routes to access urban services.},

However, the existing audit tools have mixed sidewalk-level features with neighborhood-level features when assessing sidewalk walkability and do not sufficiently consider pedestrian-related contextual and dynamic features. This study proposes a Sidewalk Walkability Assessment of Urban Roads (SWAUR) approach to separate the influences of neighborhood-level and sidewalk-level features on sidewalk walkability, and we highlight the context-based features of sidewalks, including static and dynamic features, as influential factors through observational audit surveys and attitudinal surveys of local pedestrians. These influential factors are quantified by objective and subjective measures to examine their differences in terms of sidewalk quality. Finally, sidewalk quality is integrated with neighborhood walkability to assess sidewalk walkability. A case study of the Daxin area in Shenzhen, China, demonstrates that this approach reveals the actual features influencing sidewalk walkability based on pedestrians' perceptions or physical qualities. These results can help urban designers and engineers understand the determinant factors discouraging people from walking daily for transport and take appropriate strategies to make specific neighborhoods and sidewalks more walkable.},

The distribution of commercial fitness spaces in the city is not chaotic; different types of fitness spaces should have different spaces to choose from. The purpose of this article is to summarize the spatial distribution characteristics and laws of urban commercial fitness spaces, to help better develop commercial fitness spaces. Using Changchun (a central city in northeastern China) as an example, the article divides commercial fitness spaces into five categories. Then, GIS tools are used to analyze the distribution patterns, level distributions, and agglomeration characteristics of commercial fitness spaces. The city's commercial fitness space distribution patterns are subjected to further study, along with the influencing factors and forming mechanisms of the pattern. Moreover, based on the research results, this study provides targeted suggestions for the development of fitness spaces. The study found that the commercial fitness space in Changchun city has formed a multi-core spatial pattern. Various types of fitness spaces show significant spatial differentiation in many aspects, such as ``center-periphery'' characteristics, the spatial distribution form, and the specialized characteristics of each block unit. Fitness needs, national policies, transportation accessibility, spatial agglomeration, land rent, urban population distribution, etc., are the main factors affecting the spatial distributions of fitness spaces.},

  abstract = {Until a few years ago, the elderly were considered as fragile, lonely, marginalized citizens, unable to live independently and had generally been "invisible" in studies and planning instruments that involved the governance of urban transformations. In recent years, a major focus of attention has been paid to the matter in urban development policies too (OECD, 2015), which should be oriented towards the construction of an urban model aimed at reducing the social exclusion of the elderly. For this purpose, this contribution describes a first research segment developed by the University of Naples operating unit concerning the definition of a set of variables to measure accessibility of the elderly segment of the population to the neighbourhood scale. In particular, the paper pursues a twofold objective: cognitive and methodological. Firstly, to outline the cognitive framework on the issue of urban accessibility for the elderly through a review of the main studies on this topic, the plans of sustainable urban mobility, the service plans and the governance tools for urban transformation, as well as of the most recent European best practices. The cognitive framework shall allow identifying the limits to be overcome in the reorganisation of the city. Secondly, this paper is intended to identify the set of significant variables taken from the cognitive framework and quantify its specific weight. The paper also proposes a first parameterization of the variables in the GIS environment, which refer to quantitative geo-localized data rather than collected from sample surveys, such as interviews, widely used in literature.},

Objective and perceived walkability attributes were categorized using median splits, and correlates of non-concordance were determined using multiple logistic regression models.There was a fair overall agreement between objectively determined walkability and perceived walkability (Kappa\,=\,0.35, 95\% CI\,=\,0.31--0.39). Among those resident in objectively assessed high walkable areas (n\,=\,1,063), 32.1\% perceived them to be low walkable; conversely, 32.7\% (n\,=\,1,021) resident in objectively determined low walkability areas perceived them to be high. For residents of objectively determined high walkable areas, the characteristics that differentiated those with perceptions of low walkability (non-concordant perceptions) from those with concordant perceptions of high walkability were: not being university-educated (OR\,=\,1.47, 95\% CI\,=\,1.06--2.04); having lower household incomes (OR\,=\,1.54, 95\% CI\,=\,1.09--2.17); being overweight (OR\,=\,1.46, 95\% CI\,=\,1.03--2.07); and walking fewer days per week for transport (OR\,=\,1.75, 95\% CI\,=\,1.11--2.70). Higher walking times and more positive cognitive variables were noted among participants who lived in a neighborhood with low walkability that was perceived as high compared to those who lived in a high walkable environment that was perceived as low walkable.Adults with lower educational attainment and lower incomes, who were overweight, or who were less physically active for transportation purposes, were more likely to misperceive their high walkable neighborhood as low walkable. There is the potential for physical activity promotion and persuasion strategies to address non-concordant perceptions, especially among those who live in high walkable environments but perceive them to be low and also among those who are socially disadvantaged and are less active. Perceptions of environmental attributes may be more strongly correlated with cognitive antecedents and with behavior than are objective measures.},

  abstract = {Background The neighbourhood built environment (BE) provides opportunities for regular walking for transport (WfT). Within the same city, age differences in WfT can vary significantly across neighbourhoods, although little is known about the reasons for this variation. This cross-sectional study investigated the contribution of the BE to explaining age differences in WfT across neighbourhoods. Methods This investigation used baseline (2007) data from the How Areas in Brisbane Influence HealTh and AcTivity (HABITAT) Study. The sample included 11,035 residents aged 40--65 years living in 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia (68.4\% response rate). Self-reported weekly minutes of WfT were categorized into none (0\,mins) and any (1--840\,mins); age was categorized into 40--48, 49--57 and 58--65 years. Objectively assessed neighbourhood-level measures of the BE included residential density, street connectivity and land-use mix. Analyses involved multilevel binomial logistic regression with age as main predictor, adjusting for gender, socioeconomic position, residential self-selection, and neighbourhood disadvantage. Results On average, older adults were significantly less likely to walk for transport. Age differences in WfT seemed to vary significantly across neighbourhoods, and the magnitude of the variation for older groups was twice that of their younger counterparts. The environmental measures analysed played a relatively limited role in explaining neighbourhood differences in the age-WfT relationship. Residential density and street connectivity explained up to 13\% and 9\% respectively of the observed between-neighbourhood variation in WfT across age groups. Conclusion Neighbourhood-level factors semeed to influenced the WfT of younger and older adults differently, with older adults being more sensitive to their neighbourhood environment. In Brisbane, age differences in WfT were smaller in areas with higher residential density and street connectivity. These results favor the ongoing investigation of demographic heterogeneity around neighbourhood averages in other urban contexts to inform tailored ecological interventions that facilitate WfT for all age groups everywhere, supporting active aging communities.},

  abstract = {Objectives:  To examine whether per capita income and income inequality are independently associated with teen birth rate in populous U.S. counties. Methods: This study used 1990 U.S. Census data and National Center for Health Statistics birth data. Income inequality was measured with the 90:10 ratio, a ratio of percent of cumulative income held by the richest and poorest population deciles. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to assess associations between county-level average income, income inequality, and teen birth rates among counties with population greater than 100,000. Results: Among teens aged 15-17, income inequality and per capita income were independently associated with birth rate; the mean birth rate was 54 per 1,000 in counties with low income and high income inequality, and 19 per 1,000 in counties with high income and low inequality. Among older teens (aged 18-19) only per capita income was significantly associated with birth rate. Conclusions: Although teen childbearing is the result of individual behaviors, these findings suggest that community-level factors such as income and income inequality may contribute significantly to differences in teen birth rates.},

This study develops an approach for accurately estimating sky view factor (SVF), tree view factor (TVF), and building view factor (BVF) of street canyons in the high-density urban environment of Hong Kong using publicly available Google Street View (GSV) images and a deep-learning algorithm for extraction of street features (sky, trees, and buildings). As a result, SVF, TVF, and BVF maps of street canyons are generated. Verification using reference data of hemispheric photography from field surveys in compact high-rise and lowrise areas shows that the GSV-based VF estimates have a satisfying agreement with the reference data (all with R2 {$>$} 0.95), suggesting the effectiveness and high accuracy of the developed method. This is the first reported use of hemispheric photography for direct verification in a GSV-based streetscape study. Furthermore, a comparison between GSV-based and 3D-GIS-based SVFs shows that the two SVF estimates are significantly correlated (R2 = 0.40, p {$<$} 0.01) and show better agreement in high-density areas. However, the latter overestimates SVF by 0.11 on average, and the differences between them are significantly correlated with street trees (R2 = 0.53): the more street trees, the larger the difference. This suggests that a lack of street trees in a 3D-GIS model of street environments is the dominant factor contributing to the large discrepancies between the two datasets.},

Physical activities provide an important way for older people to stay healthy. Green space is recognized as an important environmental setting for physical activity. Therefore, improving elderly accessibility to green space is useful in promoting more physical activity among them. The aim of this study is to modeling and assessing the elderly accessibility to urban green spaces in Hong Kong, by (1) modeling urban green spaces available for elderly people using the landscape fragmentation index (LFI) of green space patches, and (2) accessibility analysis in terms of both distance and time for elderly people to get urban green space patches. As a result, regions with LFI from high to low and accessibility from good to poor are Kowloon, Hong Kong Island, and New Territories. Kowloon has the highest LFI and accessibility. However, it is limited by small size green space patches which may not be in good quality and attractive for elder people. New Territories, due to its large number of available lands, has the largest proportion of big size green space patches. However, they are limited by their poor accessibility. Based on these evidences, we would suggest the prior improvement (1) in Kowloon is to have more green spaces with larger sizes, (2) in New Territories is to increase the green space accessibility either by improving the walking routes or building more small to median size green space patches that can well cover the whole region.},

It holds that taking road space from cars is justified from social, health, environmental and economic viewpoints. Yet, any change in urban transport cultures has to consider the automobile, which has instrumental as well as symbolic and affective functions. City planners are advised never to argue against the car, and to frame change in ways that reduces resistance by drivers and automotive lobbies.},

Increasingly research has focused on associations between walking behaviours and neighbourhood environments including street characteristics such as pavement availability and aesthetics. Nevertheless, objective assessment of street-level data is challenging. This research investigates the reliability of a new street characteristic audit tool designed for use with Google Street View, and assesses levels of agreement between computer-based and on-site auditing. Methods: The Forty Area STudy street VIEW (FASTVIEW) tool, a Google Street View based audit tool, was developed incorporating nine categories of street characteristics. Using the tool, desk-based audits were conducted by trained researchers across one large UK town during 2011. Both inter and intra-rater reliability were assessed. On-site street audits were also completed to test the criterion validity of the method. All reliability scores were assessed by percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. Results: Within-rater agreement was high for each category of street characteristic (range: 66.7\%-90.0\%) and good to high between raters (range: 51.3\%-89.1\%). A high level of agreement was found between the Google Street View audits and those conducted in-person across the nine categories examined (range: 75.0\%-96.7\%). Conclusion: The audit tool was found to provide a reliable and valid measure of street characteristics. The use of Google Street View to capture street characteristic data is recommended as an efficient method that could substantially increase potential for large-scale objective data collection.},

This paper introduces the results of dynamic analysis on monitoring and assessing heavily impacted areas affected by the Wenchuan Earthquake using remote sensing data acquired in the past 3 years from 2008 to 2010. Immediately after the disaster on 12 May 2008, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a project entitled `Wenchuan Earthquake Disasters Monitoring and Assessment Using Remote Sensing Technology.' More than 400 images from 17 satellites and 20.2TB airborne remote sensing data were acquired to facilitate quick monitoring and evaluation of severely damaged areas in 14 counties. Results of the image analyses were forwarded on a timely basis to assist with consultative service and decision-making support. In subsequent years, in order to monitor the process of environmental restoration and reconstruction, airborne optical remote sensing images covering most of the severely damaged areas were again acquired in May 2009 and April 2010. These images were analyzed and compared along with images from 2008. Results were useful in support of further work on environmental protection and reconstruction in earthquake-damaged areas. Three typical areas were selected for illustrative purposes including Tangjiashan Barrier Lake, Beichuan County, and counties of Yingxiu and the new Beichuan. These results well demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the utility of earth observation for disaster mitigation and reconstruction.},

We propose to apply Neighbourhood Centrality, which aggregates the network centrality values in a geographic area. We uncover that the neighbourhood eigenvector centrality can explain for up to 79\% of the variations in: (1) the age demographics, (2) the choice in transportation mode, and (3) the price and choice of housing. This sheds light on some of the complexities that surround public transport networks and its relation to urban human geography, and can prove useful for the design of future smart city transport systems.},

However, limited attempts have been made to explore the demographic and spatial heterogeneity of the built environment's effects in dense urban or peripheral urban contexts. With the outward urban expansion brought about by rapid suburban growth in Chinese cities, there have been dynamic built environment, service, and socioeconomic composition changes in the suburbs. Using data from Xiamen, China, this study employs a BO-LightGBM method to fill this gap among different cohorts of the aging population (different personal statuses and family relationships) within two contexts, and the SHAP method is adopted to interpret the models with distinctive spatial patterns of built environment differentiation. Our results show that differentiation in the threshold values and gradients exists between built environment associations and the elderly's active travel in Inner Xiamen and Outer Xiamen. The contribution of built environment variables to impact older adult's active travel is related to the regional context as well as demographic characteristics. These results offer nuanced and contextualized built environment interventions for building age-friendly cities.},

While many cities, mostly in Eastern Europe, are still shrinking today, other cities that shrunk in the past now see new growth. Numerous cities have undergone this transformation from shrinkage towards new growth within only one or two decades~-- a relatively short time. Both shrinkage and regrowth have considerable impacts on urban land use, be it on densities or types of use. Both offer a variety of potentials and risks for sustainable use of urban land as well as for the provision of green spaces and urban ecosystem services (UES). On the one hand, there is the risk that new growth after shrinkage puts pressure on the qualities that emerged and/or were created in the time of shrinkage such as less density, more green areas, or spaces for experimentation and innovation, will be questioned in their existence and benefit. On the other hand, regrowth after shrinkage offers the great opportunity to make use of those qualities in order to build more sustainable regrowing cities and to ensure good provision of environmental qualities and ecosystem services for large segments of the population. Here, many trade-offs emerge, and many new challenges have to be addressed. Often, there is a complex setting of actors and interests that make it complicated to negotiate solutions.},

  abstract = {Development of non-motorized modes of transportation has recently become a common trait among urban planners toward sustainable transportation, and walkability has been introduced as one of the most interesting concepts in the past two decades. A number of researchers put efforts to develop walkability indices (WIs) to show the status of walkability for specific zones. However, further investigation has not been conducted to account for the effect of trip purposes on WI. The literature presented transportation network design (design), land use diversity (diversity) and population density (density) as main built environment criteria and previous studies have used these criteria to develop different indices to capture walkability. In this paper, the concept of WI is developed based on the zonal walk share. Therefore, a WI has been developed and then calibrated across three specific trip purposes (i.e., job, educational and shopping) in addition to all of the trips on 112 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) of the city of Rasht, Iran. According to the result of this study, diversity was found to be the most prominent criterion with the WIs. Furthermore, WI was discovered more beneficial for describing the term of walk share in shopping trips than other trip purposes.},

  abstract = {The Walk Score{\textregistered} index has become increasingly applied in studies of walking and walkability. The index assesses the ``walking potential'' of a place through a combination of three elements: the shortest distance to a group of preselected destinations, the block length, and the intersection density around the origin. The Index links a gravity-based measure (distance accessibility), with topological accessibility (street connectivity) measured by two complementary indicators that act as penalties in the final score (linearly expanded in the range 0--100). A systematic review of Scopus{\textregistered} and Web of Science{\textregistered} was conducted with 42 journal articles eventually being evaluated. Research was primarily undertaken in North American urban geographies. Analysis of walkability using Walk Score{\textregistered} is inconsistent. Twenty-nine papers do not exclusively relying on Walk Score{\textregistered} as a single measurement of walkability and add further estimates to better capture the multiple dimensions of walkability. In 33 studies the Walk Score{\textregistered} was used as an independent variable, and only once as a mediating-moderating variable. In eight papers (18\%) the Walk Score{\textregistered} was a part of a bivariate correlation model. On no occasion was it used as a dependent variable. Results tend to only partly support the validity of Walk Score{\textregistered}. The paper concludes that the Index is best understood as a surrogate measure of the density of the built environment of a specific neighborhood that indicates utilitarian walking potential. Implications for, and potential areas of, future research are discussed.},

However, few studies have sought to examine the community-level determinants of social capital. In the present study, we examined the associations between social capital and different area characteristics: (1) neighborhood walkability, (2) date of community settlement, and (3) degree of urbanization. We based our analysis on 9414 respondents from the Aichi Gerontological Evaluation Study (AGES), conducted in 2003. No significant positive association was found between the walkability score and any of the social capital indices. In contrast, community age and degree of urbanization were associated with many of the social capital indicators, even after controlling for characteristics of the residents. Community social capital thus appears to be more consistently linked to the broader historical and geographic contexts of neighborhoods, rather than to the proximal built environment (as measured by walkability).},

In this light, it is necessary to understand the challenges faced by both the ageing population and the policymakers. Increased mobility enables individuals to perform fundamental tasks more easily and conveniently, such as going to work, accessing health services, and purchasing essential goods, besides other important activities related to recreation and socialisation. This paper examines the impact of satisfaction with transport systems on the social inclusion of older people and their wellbeing. We conducted a questionnaire survey in 18 elderly centres, one from each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong, in 2018, and used a structural equation model (SEM) with latent variables to estimate the effect of satisfaction with the most commonly used transport systems on wellbeing. Our results show that an older person's sense of community and satisfaction with their neighbourhood is strongly related to their satisfaction with transport systems. When the local transport systems are well-functioning, older people feel more socially included. Satisfaction with transport systems also has a strong effect on older people's physical and psychological wellbeing, after controlling for social inclusion. Our findings suggest that transport systems need to be adapted to become more inclusive of the older population to improve their mobility and wellbeing.},

Walkability is used to characterize the user friendliness of outdoor physical activity. However, studies on walkability and physical activity are mainly concentrated on low-density Western cities. Study on the walkability of high-density cities in Asia, especially with the elderly, is seriously lacking. And walkability is often used as a composite indicator. This study mainly re-examines the relationship between the common indicators of walkability (population density, street connectivity, land-use mix, and retail density), transport-related walking, and leisure-time walking with older adults in China's megacities. Twelve housing estates in Wuhan were selected for study areas. We explored the association between the walking activities of 1,161 elderly people ({$\geq$}60 years old) and the indicators of walkability in their neighborhoods. Socio-demographic characteristics were controlled in the multilevel logistic regression models of the built environment walking associations. We found that there was no significant correlation between the four indicators of walkability and transport-related walking. Street connectivity is significantly positively correlated with the participants' leisure-time walking (OR = 1.499, 95\% CI = 1.068{\textasciitilde}2.103), and there was no significant correlation between the other indicator of walkability and leisure-time walking. The results show that there was no statistical correlation between walkability and transport-related walking in the elderly, and only one indicator was related to leisure-time walking.

The walkability framework is developed regarding four pedestrian needs: safety, convenience, continuity, and attractiveness. The walkability elements are extracted from street view images and diverse open data sources. We quantify the importance of walkability elements from 459 questionnaires across the city as weights to calculate elderly walkability scores. More than 27 million senior walking trips were identified from 6~months of mobile phone data in 2021. We used a geographically weighted Poisson regression model to examine the spatial effects of walkability on senior walking trips. The results show that the most important pedestrian need for seniors is safety, followed in order by attractiveness, convenience, and continuity. Areas with high elderly walkability scores are largely in urban areas and suburban subcenters. Walkability exerts a strong positive role on senior walking trips in the inner suburbs.

They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them.},

  abstract = {Developing more walkable environments plays an essential role in healthy-city planning. Planners often assess the typical walkability framework from a geographic perspective based on GIS data. This paper proposes a refined walkability framework that quantifies walkability in terms of four pedestrian needs: safety, convenience, continuity, and attractiveness. Using Shenzhen as our case study, we integrate mesoscale and microscale built-environment features from different data sources: street view images (SVIs), social media, points-of-interest data, government open data, and GIS data. Deep learning semantic segmentation approaches apply to extracting street elements from SVIs. Results show that walkability and its four aspects are spatially heterogeneous in the city. Urban areas and suburban central business districts offer greater walkability than other areas. The less walkable areas are mainly in the rest of the suburbs. This work suggests that more academic and planning efforts should focus on improving walkability in less walkable neighborhoods and promoting pedestrian-friendly cities.},

  abstract = {This article describes IHC Global's ``Smart City. Just City'' initiative which it launched at a panel at the ninth World Urban Forum (WUF 9) held in Kuala Lumpur in February 2018. The initiative is a key component of IHC Global's commitment to the New Urban Agenda and to achieving the aims of Global Goal 11. By seeking to align two different approaches to urban development -- the technology driven ``smart city'' approach and the ``social justice'' informed ``just city'' approach -- its goal is to fill a policy and practice gap with a policy framework and supporting indicators which will enable cities to intentionally use technology to achieve greater inclusiveness and equity and so to create places and spaces which are both ``smart'' and ``just.'' Too often ``smart cities'' focus on technology almost exclusively and when other benefits are seen as ``by-products'' of the technology. On the other hand, the human-centered focus of ``just cities'' too often fails to think sufficiently progressively or to use available technologies to advance its goals. ``Smart City. Just City'' aims to bring these two approaches together, to show that ``technology'' and ``human centeredness'' are not mutually exclusive terms and that the often private-sector driven use of technology can in fact serve ``public good'' purposes when these purposes are intentionally pursued. IHC Global's premise is that when a city uses smart technology with the purpose to achieve greater inclusiveness and justice, divisions will be lessened; economic opportunities will be more plentiful and widely available; a large number of people will be more robustly prepared to cope with natural and other ``shocks''; and the city, as a whole, will prosper.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation is a critical and important step in (GEographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA). The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects. Recent research indicates an apparent movement towards the improvement of segmentation algorithms, aiming at more accurate, automated, and computationally efficient techniques.},

  abstract = {Under the background of global aging, outdoor public spaces play a crucial role in promoting physical activity among older individuals, helping to advance the process of healthy aging. Among these spaces, urban greenways are particularly effective in encouraging walking behaviors and improving both physical and mental health. However, current assessments of greenway's walkability have mainly focused on the general population, with scant attention paid to the viewpoint of older adults. Hence, this study proposed a novel walkability assessment framework from the perspective of the elderly, which employs multi-sourced data in conjunction with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to measure walkability, taking the renowned 45-km-long Huangpu River waterfront Greenway in Shanghai as a case study. Apart from using traditional GIS data to quantify the walkability factors, locally collected street view images using wearable GoPro were also utilized in the evaluation. According to the results of overall walkability scores, the Hongkou Riverwalk shows the best walkability for older people, followed by the Huangpu Riverwalk, the Xuhui Riverwalk, the Yangpu Riverwalk, and the East Coast Riverwalk is the worst. It is also noted that among the walkability factors, older adults place the highest value on safety facilities, green view index and seating facilities. Moreover, four greenway patterns were classified to characterize different walkability, including ``safety-dominant'' pattern, ``comfort-dominant'' pattern, ``interestingnessdominant'' pattern, ``usefulness-dominant'' pattern. Last but not least, the implications and limitations were also discussed in this paper, some of which would be the direction of our future work.},

  abstract = {Estimating road traffic noise is essential for examining the quality of sounding environment and mitigating such a non-negligible pollutant in urban areas. However, existing estimated models often have limited applicability to specific traffic conditions, while the required parameters may not be readily available for citywide collection. This paper proposes a data-driven approach for measuring road-level acoustic information of traffic with street view imagery. Specifically, we utilize portable vehicle-equipped hardware for in-situ noise acquisition and employ a deep learning model ResNet to learn high-level visual features from street view images that are closely associated with road traffic noise. The ResNet captures meaningful patterns from the input data, and the output probability vectors are then fed into a Random-Forest regression algorithm to quantitatively estimate the noise in decibels for different road segments. The MAE and RMSE of the DCNN-RF model are 2.01 and 2.71, respectively. Additionally, we employ a gradient-weighted Class Active Mapping approach to visually interpret our deep learning model and explore the significant elements in streetscapes that contribute to the model's estimations. Our proposed framework facilitates low-cost and finescale road traffic noise estimations and sheds light on how auditory information could be inferred from street imagery, which may benefit practices in geography and urban planning.},

Intuitively, models fusing data from different modalities outperform their uni-modal counterparts, since more information is aggregated. Recently, joining the success of deep learning, there is an influential line of work on deep multi-modal learning, which has remarkable empirical results on various applications. However, theoretical justifications in this field are notably lacking. Can multi-modal learning provably perform better than uni-modal? In this paper, we answer this question under a most popular multi-modal fusion framework, which firstly encodes features from different modalities into a common latent space and seamlessly maps the latent representations into the task space. We prove that learning with multiple modalities achieves a smaller population risk than only using its subset of modalities. The main intuition is that the former has a more accurate estimate of the latent space representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical treatment to capture important qualitative phenomena observed in real multi-modal applications from the generalization perspective. Combining with experiment results, we show that multi-modal learning does possess an appealing formal guarantee.},

Such efforts have accelerated in recent years due to advancements in technologies and the proliferation of relevant data (e.g., street view imagery, geo-tagged photos, videos, virtual reality, and aerial imagery). There has not been a comprehensive systematic review paper on this topic to reveal an overarching set of research trends, limitations, and future research opportunities. Such omission is plausibly due to the difficulty in reviewing a large number of relevant papers on this popular topic. In this study, we utilized machine learning techniques (i.e., natural language processing and large language models) to semi-automate the review process and reviewed 393 relevant papers. Through the review, we found that these papers can be categorized into the physical aspects of cities: greenery and water, street design, building design, landscape, public space, and the city as a whole. We also revealed that many studies conducted quantitative analyses with a recent trend of increasingly utilizing big data and advanced technologies, such as combinations of street view imagery and deep learning models. Limitations and research gaps were also identified as follows: (1) a limited scope in terms of study areas, sample size, and attributes; (2) low quality of subjective and visual data; and (3) the need for more controlled and sophisticated methods to infer more closely examined impacts of visual features on human perceptions. We suggest that future studies utilize and contribute to open data and take advantage of existing data and technologies to examine the causality of visual features on human perception. The approach developed to accelerate this review proved to be accurate, efficient, and insightful. Considering its novelty, we also describe it to enable replications in the future.},

The crisis of the activity of old industrial cities creating the economic base (especially of the traditional industry), provoked by the deindustrialisation process and in post-socialist countries additionally by the ``shock'' of the economic transformation, caused long-lasting and unfavourable changes in many areas. It resulted in the present process of shrinkage of old industrial cities in demographic, economic, social aspects as well as spatial ones (Bontje 2004; Oswalt 2005; Turok, Mykhnenko 2007; Pallagst et al. 2009; Cunningham-Sabot et al. 2010; Bontje, Musterd 2012; Hospers 2012, 2014; Haase et al. 2013; Pallagst et al. 2014; Stryjakiewicz 2014; Runge et al. 2018). This process can take a different course in different socio-economic patterns depending on the geographical situation and the time of observation. However, it leads to unfavourable results in each place, first of all to a decrease in the number of inhabitants. The aim of the article is twofold: (1) the identification and analysis of the process of urban shrinkage of Wa{\l}brzych city as well as (2) the examination of different regeneration strategies adopted to mitigate negative effects of urban shrinkage. It is particularly important to understand this process and results of the adopted strategies especially in the context of the future development of this city which according to demographic forecasts will be shrinking in the long run.},

As expected by the United Nations (UN), by the year 2050, 68.4\% of the world population will live in cities with a population of 20,000 or more. Due to enormous socio-economic pressures resulting from population expansion, urbanization and intensive changes in the landscape, an urban development program to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable has become of the utmost importance since the 2005 World Summit in Rio and further adopted in 2015 by UN as the "2030 Agenda" for Sustainable Development. The study focused on monitoring the SDG 11 target 11.3.1. they are defined as a ratio of land consumption rate to the population growth rate because mapping urban land quickly and accurately is indispensable for watershed run-off prediction and other planning applications. There is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land sprawl or population growth. However, remote sensing methods and satellite-derived data make it possible to monitor urban growth rates over large areas in a relatively short time. There are many techniques for urban land cover automatically mapping. These techniques can be broadly grouped into two general types: those based on the input data classification, including pixel- and object-based classifications and those based on directly segmenting the indices, such as the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized build-up area index (NDBI), and their modifications.},

  abstract = {The 15-minute community life circle (15-min CLC) concept focuses on providing accessible services for older adults within a short walking distance. However, few studies have developed a comprehensive evaluation system of 15-min CLC walking accessibility for older people, and little is known about the effects of street-level environment characteristics and human perception on 15-min CLC. This study used the Baidu API and an optimized cumulative opportunity method to measure the 5-, 10-, and 15-min CLC walkability for older adults in Suzhou, China. Street-level characteristics and human perception scores, derived from street view semantic segmentation and deep learning, were incorporated into regression models to assess global and local effects on walkability. The results revealed that there was a significant spatial heterogeneity of CLC walkability in Suzhou. The 5- and 10min CLCs were found lacking in facilities, particularly senior care services. The regression model showed a positive association between perceived safety and CLC walkability, while the proportion of street vegetation negatively affected walkability. The study suggests enhancing senior care, medical, and leisure facilities, especially within 10-min CLCs. Improving service integration in county-level cities and suburbs, and increasing street vegetation in older urban areas, could further enhance the walking environment for older adults.},

  abstract = {The easy availability and widespread use of remotely-sensed imagery, especially Google Earth satellite imagery, makes it simple for urban forestry professionals to assess a site and measure tree cover density without visiting the site. Remotely-sensed tree cover density has become the dominant criterion for urban forestry regulations in many countries, but it is unclear how much such measures match the eye-level tree cover density that people experience; or the information gained through site visits, eye-level photography, or from consulting with citizens. To address this uncertainty, we assessed associations among two remotely-sensed and three eye-level tree cover density measures for 140 community street sites across the Midwestern United States with low, medium, or high tree cover coverage by using linear regression analysis. We found significant associations among the two remotely-sensed measures and the three eye-level measures across the three levels of tree cover. The associations between any pair of remotely-sensed and eye-level measures, however, diminish dramatically as canopy cover increased. At high levels of canopy cover, all associations between the remotely-sensed measures and the eye-level measures became statistically insignificant. These findings suggest that measures from remotely-sensed imagery fail to represent the amount of tree cover people perceive at eye-level when canopy cover is medium or high at the site scale. Therefore, the current urban forestry planning regulations, which rely heavily on remotely-sensed tree cover density measurements, need to be revised. We suggest strategic spots where eye-level measures of tree cover density should be emphasized.},

  abstract = {Scaling of geographic space refers to the fact that for a large geographic area its small constituents or units are much more common than the large ones. This article develops a novel perspective to the scaling of geographic space using large street networks involving both cities and countryside. Given a street network of an entire country, we decompose the street network into individual blocks, each of which forms a minimum ring or cycle such as city blocks and field blocks. The block sizes demonstrate the scaling property, that is, far more small blocks than large ones. Interestingly, we find that the mean of all the block sizes can easily separate between small and large blocks --a high percentage (e.g., 90\%) of smaller ones and a low percentage (e.g., 10\%) of larger ones. Based on this regularity, termed as the head/tail division rule, we propose an approach to delineating city boundaries by grouping the smaller blocks. The extracted city sizes for the three largest European countries (France, Germany, and United Kingdom) exhibit power law distributions. We further define the concept of border number as a topological distance of a block far from the outmost border to map the center(s) of the country and the city. We draw an analogy between a country (or a city or geographic space in general) and a complex organism like the human body or the human brain to further elaborate on the power of this block perspective in reflecting the structure or patterns of geographic space.},

A related trend is toward delayed marriage and nonmarriage. When prevalence of cohabitation in European countries is allowed for, levels of ``effective singlehood'' in many countries of Pacific Asia have run ahead of those in northern and western Europe. This raises questions about the extent to which delayed marriage has been implicated in fertility declines, and whether the same factors are leading both to delayed marriage and to lowered fertility within marriage. The article argues that involuntary nonmarriage is likely to be more common in Pacific Asia than in Western countries, and that resultant involuntary childlessness plays a substantial role in the low fertility rates currently observed.},

Habitat loss, along with poaching, can undermine the international target recovery of doubling the number of wild tigers by 2022. Using a new satellite-based monitoring system, we analyzed 14 years of forest loss data within the 76 landscapes (ranging from 278 to 269,983 km2) that have been prioritized for conservation of wild tigers. Our analysis provides an update of the status of tiger habitat and describes new applications of technology to detect precisely where forest loss is occurring in order to curb future habitat loss. Across the 76 landscapes, forest loss was far less than anticipated (79,597 {\textpm} 22,629 km2, 7.7\% of remaining habitat) over the 14-year study period (2001-2014). Habitat loss was unevenly distributed within a subset of 29 landscapes deemed most critical for doubling wild tiger populations: 19 showed little change (1.5\%), whereas 10 accounted for more than 98\% (57,392 {\textpm} 16,316 km2) of habitat loss. Habitat loss in source population sites within 76 landscapes ranged from no loss to 435 {\textpm} 124 km2 (-x 24 km2, SD = 89, total = 1676 {\textpm} 476 km2). Doubling the tiger population by 2022 requires moving beyond tracking annual changes in habitat. We highlight near-real-time forest monitoring technologies that provide alerts of forest loss at relevant spatial and temporal scales to prevent further erosion. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.},

In Europe, more than 70\% of the population lives in urban areas today. This number is likely to increase to 84\% by 2050. However, a shift from growth to decline of urban population is already present for a growing number of cities. The paper examines urban population trends for 158 European agglomerations and assesses the dynamics behind one particular development of growth or decline. Using data from 1991 to 2004, we present statistical evidence of diversifying population trajectories for core cities and fringe areas. The quantitative results are contrasted with the widespread accepted cyclical urbanisation model that has been expounded as a theoretical approach to describe previous and future stages of European urban development. The structural approach of the model is discussed because we believe that such concepts do not reflect the dynamics of present urban development in Europe. The paper argues that the urban agglomerations studied do not show a single evolutionary stage of urban development. Rather, we found a coexistence of intensifying suburbanisation and developing reurbanisation, which is mainly driven by younger households. Copyright {\copyright} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, traditional methods of measuring urban greenery involve limitations in coverage of various forms of greenery and do not reflect the actual degree of exposure to pedestrians. Accordingly, this study examined the street Green View Index (GVI) and its associations with walking activities by different income groups using survey data on walking behaviors in 2350 residents in Seoul, Korea. This study utilized Google Street View (GSV) and deep learning to calculate the GVI by semantic segmentation, referring to greenness from the visual perspective of pedestrians. Correlation analyses between traditional greenery variables and GVI were conducted to examine differences, and multiple regression models were applied to identify the relationships between walking time and greenery variables. The results of this study show differences between conventional greenery variables and GVI in terms of specific greenery forms and perspectives. As hypothesized, GVI was more closely associated with walking time than the traditional greenery variables. Also, this study found that the low-income residents generally lived in low GVI neighborhood, but walking time is more sensitive to GVI. These results were because GVI represents the actual greenery exposure to pedestrians, and there was a difference between income groups in the degree of vehicle usage in daily life. The results of this study indicate that, when analyzing the relationship between urban greenness and walking behavior, it is necessary to examine the relationship from multiple angles and to investigate the importance of eye-level street greenery. Our findings provide useful insights for public policies to promote pedestrian walking environments.},

To address this gap, we developed a new walkability index that encompasses both micro-level and macro-level attributes using Google Street View (GSV) data and computer vision algorithms. The outperformance of the new index is validated through its alignment with pedestrian-rated overall walking environment satisfaction. The findings of this study underscore the limitations of the Walk-score by revealing a significant disparity with walking environment satisfaction. The validation tests confirm that our new index is superior to the Walk-score because it provides comprehensive reflections of satisfaction. Our results suggest the need for a new walkability index that includes streetscapes as well as macrolevel features. Overall, our new index provides urban planners and analysts with an improved metric to capture various built environmental features for planning practice.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the role of walking in explaining associations between perceived and objective measures of walkability and cognitive function among older adults. The study employed a crosssectional design analyzing existing data. Data were obtained from the Adult Changes in Thought Activity Monitor study. Cognitive function and perceived walkability were measured by a survey. Objective walkability was measured using geographic information systems (GIS). Walking was measured using an accelerometer. We tested the mediating relationship based on 1,000 bootstrapped samples. Perceived walkability was associated with a 0.04 point higher cognitive function score through walking (p = 0.006). The mediating relationship accounted for 34\% of the total relationship between perceived walkability and cognitive function. Walking did not have a significant indirect relationship on the association between objective walkability and cognitive function. Perceived walkability may be more relevant to walking behavior than objective walkability among older adults. Greater levels of perceived walkability may encourage older adults to undertake more walking, and more walking may in turn improve cognitive function in older adults.},

We used a total of 117,259 GPS points and 160 personday data points for elderly individuals living in Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The differences in the walking environments selected based on the walking purpose were analyzed using a random forest method, and the nonlinear relationship was investigated. In addition, an in-depth analysis was performed by adopting an interpretation approach from global and local perspectives. The findings highlight the significance of walking street pleasure and network properties for leisure walking. Specifically, a green area ratio of 15 \% or more positively relationship path choice for leisure, underscoring the importance of sufficient green space. Conversely, the high proportion of green areas typically has negative implications for commercial walking. Road connectivity and integration are predominantly negatively associated with route choice for leisure, indicating a decreased preference for highly integrated roads during leisure walking activities. These findings provide valuable insights for an evidence-based urban design strategy to make walkable environments. It can contribute to urban planning and policy, particularly the development of tailored walkable environments for the older population.},

We estimated models at each 2-hour time slot (for weekdays and weekends), separately, to look at the effect of the walkability measure on crime at different hours of the day. Our results show that the crime-enhancing effect of physical environment for walkability changes across different hours of the day, and such temporal patterns vary by different types of crime. Crime-enhancing effect of physical environment for walkability is relatively stronger during very early morning time (midnight-4~am), and the risk of crime as a result of neighborhood walkability peaks~in the late afternoon (2--4 or 4--6 pm). The measure of physical environment for walkability has different effect on crime patterns across hours of the day as the usage and meaning of physical environment and routine activities of people visiting the area, and thus the structures of criminal opportunities and guardianship capability temporally vary at different time periods.},

  abstract = {Active living improves the lives and social networks of the elderly. In terms of active living, walkability is an essential element in the daily life of the elderly. To support active living, it is important to create an age-friendly environment. Considering that the elderly carry out a large part of their activities by walking, a good walkable environment is one of the most important elements of an age-friendly environment. Existing studies have involved surveys of experts, audit tools, and questionnaires. However, despite their merits, current methods of measuring walkability remain limited as they do not include the actual walking activity of the elderly. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of using a wearable sensor to measure the walking of the elderly quantitatively, and to compare different walking environments based on data collected from their actual walking. To accomplish this, experiments were conducted in four types of environments with 30 elderly subjects. During the experiments, the subjects were asked to attach a smartphone that includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The IMU sensor collected the body movement using tri-axial accelerations. The collected data were used to calculate walkability by investigating how constant a subject's walking pattern is. The consistency of pattern can be regarded as gait stability that can be quantitatively measured via the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MaxLE---a metric used for measuring the stability of human body during locomotion. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the stability of walking of elderly people differs according to the walking environment, which means that by investigating the stability the current conditions of a specific walking environment can be inferred. This result helps improve the active life of the elderly by providing opportunities for continuous diagnosis of the walking environment.},

The methodology was developed as part of a larger study on whether densification in public transport nodes outside city centres in Norwegian cities is a good strategy for reducing traffic in cities, what can be done to increase the traffic-reducing effects, and how improved walkability can be part of this. We define walkability as to what extent the surroundings are nice to walk in, as well as pleasant and interesting, and inviting walking. Criteria for assessing walkability are divided into three categories: Infrastructure and traffic, Urbanity, and Surroundings and activities, with specified attributes attached. Data were collected from existing data sources, fieldwork, and interviews. We used the data to assess degree of walkability for each node on a scale from highly walkable to not walkable and found that walkability of the four investigated nodes varied from not walkable to walkable. The car-driver shares on travels related to the nodes were rather high, and we argue that they could be lowered by among others reducing car accessibility and improving walkability. We experienced that our methodology worked as intended at the neighbourhood-scale. If used at a larger scale, the approach could be supplemented by GIS tools. Interviews indicate that our perceptions as researchers are not necessarily in accordance of those of users of the streets. Use of Public Participation GIS tools could give a better understanding of these differences, and how this might be dealt with. Making cities more walkable is increasingly understood as a necessary part of sustainable urban development. By sharing experiences from using our methodology, we hope to contribute with relevant input to the ongoing discussions in cities across the world on how to measure walkability and how to develop cities and areas to become more walkable.},

Therefore, we combined the results of an expert workshop, a literature review, and a Delphi consensus survey. Through this, we identified and rated indicators relevant for walkability for older adults, additionally focusing on their functional status. The expert workshop and the review led to an extensive list of potential indicators, which we hope will be useful in future research. Those indicators were then adapted and rated in a three-stage Delphi expert survey. A fourth additional Delphi round was conducted to assess the relevance of each indicator for the different frailty levels, namely ``robust,'' ``pre-frail,'' and ``frail.'' Between 20 and 28 experts participated in each round of the Delphi survey. The Delphi process resulted in a list of 72 indicators deemed relevant for walkability in older age groups, grouped into three main categories: ``Built environment and transport infrastructure,'' ``Accessibility and meeting places,'' and ``Attractiveness and sense of security.'' For 35 of those indicators, it was suggested that functional status should be additionally considered. This framework represents a significant step forward in comprehensively covering indicators for subjective and objective walkability in older age, while also incorporating aspects of functioning relevant to older adults. It would be beneficial to test and apply the indicator set in a community setting.},

Earlier studies have indicated that learning from flood experiences can affect flood risk perception and the adoption of PLFRA measures; however, it remains unclear whether and how this learning process can be affected by flood control infrastructure---specifically, the level of flood resistance it offers. This study attempts to answer the question: Do people living in environments with different levels of flood resistance learn different lessons from flood experience, manifested in flood risk perception and PLFRA? We present a comparative study of the rural village of Xinnongcun and the urban community of Nanhuyayuan in Central China. In-person interviews with a total of 34 local residents were conducted to understand how flood experiences affect flood risk perception and PLFRA. We find that learning from flood experiences in the highly flood-resistant environment (Nanhuyayuan) does not contribute to flood risk perception but further enhances flood resistance, whereas learning in a less flood-resistant environment (Xinnongcun) leads to a better understanding of flood risk and promotes PLFRA. We argue that flood resistance can affect the learning from flood experiences. High flood resistance can suppress PLFRA through a different learning process that involves learning inertia and path dependency. In the search for flood resilience, this begs society to re-examine the widespread assertion that both structural and nonstructural measures are important in flood risk management.},

To understand neighborhood walkability and its effects on older adults' walking trips, we first classify neighborhoods using K-means clustering algorithm based on neighborhood-built environment attributes and access to urban amenities. We then employ negative binomial regression models to analyze the determinants of older adults' walking trips, with a focus on the effects of household income and neighborhood walkability. Key findings from our empirical analyses are as follows. First, older adults with physical disabilities tend to have fewer walk trips as compared to those without disabilities. Second, subjective health conditions are critical for older adults' walking trips. Third, increasing household income decreases walking frequency. Fourth, after controlling for various other factors, older adults living in walkable neighborhoods have more frequent walking trips. Fifth, although an increase in household income leads to decreases in older adults' walking trips, high neighborhood walkability moderates this effect and reduces the adverse effect on walking trip frequencies.},

Nevertheless, these walkability attributes may affect walking behavior differently depending on the time of the day. This study examined the association between neighborhood environmental attributes and average step counts at different times of the day. Methods: We included 122 older adults (aged {$\geq$} 60 years, mean age: 70.0 years) from Taiwan in this study. Neighborhood environmental attributes were estimated using a geographic information system. An accelerometer was used to calculate their daily step counts during three time periods: morning (6:00 to 12:00), afternoon (12:01 to 18:00), and night (18:01 to 24:00). In this cross-sectional study, we performed multiple linear regression after adjustment for potential covariates to examine the correlation of five walkability attributes, namely residential density, street connectivity, sidewalk availability, destination accessibility, and public transportation accessibility, with total step counts during different time periods. Results: Sidewalk availability, destination accessibility, and public transportation accessibility demonstrated a positive association with older adults' step counts during morning. No association was found between any neighborhood environment attribute and older adults' total step count during afternoon and night. Conclusions: Neighborhoods with high sidewalk availability, access to destinations, and public transportation accessibility may encourage older adults' walking behavior during morning. Future research applying longitudinal methods is required to understand how the time of the day affects environment's role in supporting walking behavior.},

This study bridges insitu observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial--temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year.

  abstract = {There are two opposing trends in urban development: one is the exponential growth of cities and the other is shrinking cities,'' which are characterized by a decrease in number of residents. Since the 2008 financial crisis, there have been great changes in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), where growing and shrinking areas coexist. In this paper, we analyze cities' growth and shrinkage in respect of urban construction and economic vitality in the PRD in spatial term. Thus, we define land use changes in urban construction to characterize growth by using Landsat Thematic Mapper data on urban built-up areas of the PRD region in 2000, 2009, and 2013; and we characterize economic activities for vitality by using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime light data in various years after time continuous correction and vegetation correction, in combination with population data. Four different types of space are identified in this region, namely continuous growth, transformational growth, stationary, and shrinkage. This paper provides policy recommendations and planning strategies for the future development of shrinking cities in China. Shrinkage is considered to be only a short-term stage in the urbanization process faced by most cities in China and abroad. Technological progress and industrial transformation are likely to be critical factors affecting the direction of urban development, where cities can resume growth from shrinkage by revitalizing manufacturing industry and economic activities through education, innovation, and technology.

  abstract = {Background: High quality built environments are important for human health and wellbeing. Numerous studies have characterized built environment physical features and environmental exposures, but few have examined urban perceptions at geographic scales needed for population-based research. The degree to which urban perceptions are associated with different environmental features, and traditional environmental exposures such as air pollution or urban green space, is largely unknown. Objective: To determine built environment factors associated with safety, lively and beauty perceptions across 56 cities. Methods: We examined perceptions collected in the open source Place Pulse 2.0 dataset, which assigned safety, lively and beauty scores to street view images based on crowd-sourced labelling. We derived built environment measures for the locations of these images (110,000 locations across 56 global cities) using GIS and remote sensing datasets as well as street view imagery features (e.g. trees, cars) using deep learning image segmentation. Linear regression models were developed using Lasso penalized variable selection to predict perceptions based on visible (street level images) and GIS/remote sensing built environment variables. Results: Population density, impervious surface area, major roads, traffic air pollution, tree cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed statistically significant differences between high and low safety, lively, and beauty perception locations. Visible street level features explained approximately 18\% of the variation in safety, lively, and beauty perceptions, compared to 3--10\% explained by GIS/remote sensing. Large differences in prediction were seen when modelling between city (R2 67--81\%) versus within city (R2 11--13\%) perceptions. Important predictor variables included visible accessibility features (e.g. streetlights, benches) and roads for safety, visible plants and buildings for lively, and visible green space and NDVI for beauty. Conclusion: Substantial within and between city differences in built environment perceptions exist, which visible street level features and GIS/remote sensing variables only partly explain. This offers a new research avenue to expand built environment measurement methods to include perceptions in addition to physical features.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. Objective: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. Methods: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework--Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. Results: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7\%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.},

After the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has continued to increase. This situation may be prolonged until an effective, tested, and safe treatment is available. COVID-19 can occur at any age. However, the maximum confirmed cases and deaths have occurred among the elderly. Particularly, the mental and physical health of the elderly aged above 60 and classified as high-risk groups is more vulnerable than other age groups, requiring more attention. Strong social restraint, social distancing, and quarantine measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread have raised concerns about their mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and identify the psychological concepts and protective factors that support and constitute these guidelines and strategies and prepare practical suggestions and guidelines to protect the mental health of the elderly during COVID-19. These discussions will facilitate a deeper understanding and expansion of these guidelines and strategies. Therefore, this study explores factors---including pandemic-induced stress, self-integration, self-efficacy, and resilience---in order to prepare practical and detailed suggestions and guidelines using studies that considered these factors, including coping with COVID-19-induced stress, social support, and physical activity.},

In this context, we propose a new method for learning semantic segmentation models robust against fog. Its key idea is to consider the fog condition of an image as its style and close the gap between images with different fog conditions in neural style spaces of a segmentation model. In particular, since the neural style of an image is in general affected by other factors as well as fog, we introduce a fog-pass filter module that learns to extract a fog-relevant factor from the style. Optimizing the fog-pass filter and the segmentation model alternately gradually closes the style gap between different fog conditions and allows to learn fog-invariant features in consequence. Our method substantially outperforms previous work on three real foggy image datasets. Moreover, it improves performance on both foggy and clear weather images, while existing methods often degrade performance on clear scenes.},

  abstract = {In the past two centuries, many American urban areas have experienced significant expansion in both populating and depopulating cities. The pursuit of bigger, faster, and more growth-oriented planning parallels a situation where municipal decline has also been recognized as a global epidemic. In recent decades many older industrial cities have experienced significant depopulation, job loss, economic decline, and massive increases in vacant and abandoned properties due primarily to losses in industry and relocating populations. Despite continuous economic decline and depopulation, many of these so-called `shrinking cities' still chase growth-oriented planning policies, due partially to inabilities to accurately predict future urban growth/decline patterns. This capability is critical to understanding land use alternation patterns and predicting future possible scenarios for the development of more proactive land use policies dealing with urban decline and regeneration. In this research, the city of Chicago, Illinois, USA is used as a case site to test an urban land use change model that predicts urban decline in a shrinking city, using vacant land as a proxy. Our approach employs the Land Transformation Model (LTM), which combines Geographic Information Systems and artificial neural networks to forecast land use change. Results indicate that the LTM is a good resource to simulate urban vacant land changes. Mobility and housing market conditions seem to be the primary variables contributing to decline.},

The approach here is based on the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory (IMI), selecting 94 objectively measured items that were available and accessible using a combination of GIS and Google Street View. The goal was to test the degree to which some of the measures employed in IMI could be streamlined using GIS and Google Street View as data sources.

This study investigated the relationship between objective and subjective measures of walkability for seniors living in Toronto through a multi-phased, mixed-methods approach. Two neighbourhoods within the city were selected as case study areas. Wychwood represented a high walkability neighbourhood and Edenbridge-Humber Valley represented a neighbourhood lower in walkability. The walkability audit, the Senior Walking Environmental Assessment Tool -- Revised (SWEAT-R), served as the objective measure. Subjective measures included the use of focus groups, go-along interviews, and traditional interviews with twenty-eight seniors across both neighbourhoods. The findings of this research highlighted the efficacy of objective measures existing in literature, but these did not adequately capture the holistic relationships between seniors and their surrounding environments. The subjective measures of walkability proved especially important for understanding perceptions of walkability and walking behaviour. Additionally, the findings echo recent study findings that recommend theory-based approaches to walkability research may be more effective in accounting for human behaviour in active transportation. This study concludes with practical and theoretical recommendations for planners, public health specialists, and other experts interested in promoting active transportation for seniors.},

Existing work generally relies on manual labor or specific algorithms trained by dedicated datasets, which hinders the efficiency and applicable scenarios of methods. Street view map provides interactive panoramas of a large scale of urban roadway network, and is updated in a recurrent manner by the provider. This paper proposed a deep learning method based on a pre-trained neural network architecture to identify and locate different distress in real-time. About 20,000 street view images were collected and labeled as the training dataset using the Baidu e-map. Eight types of distress are notated using Yolov3 deep learning architecture. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors combined with GPS and bounding boxes were applied to judge the deterioration of the distress. A decision tree was designed to evaluate the change of the distress over some time. A typical road in Shanghai was selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The images of the road from 2015 to 2017 were collected from the street view map. The results showed that the mean average precision of the proposed algorithm is 88.37\%, demonstrating the vast potential of applying this method to detect pavement distress. 43 distress were newly generated, and 49 previous distress were patched in the two years. The proposed method can assist the authorities to schedule the maintenance activities more effectively.},

The comparisons are implemented from four perspectives, including temporal trip patterns, statistical characteristics (i.e., trip distance and duration), utilization efficiency, and wasted electricity during idle time. Results suggest that the similarity and difference co-exist between e-scooter sharing services in the cities, and utilization efficiency is significantly related with the number of e-scooters per person and per unit area. Surprisingly, on average nearly 33\% of electricity are wasted during idle time in these cities.

It was found that the increase in the birth rate has a significantly negative effect on human capital accumulation, while the effect of the birth rate on human capital shows an inverted `U' shape. That is, when birth rate decreases, human capital increases, and when birth rate increases, human capital decreases. Thus, too low or too high birth rates will reduce human capital. Ultimately, human capital accumulation will significantly promote the growth and decomposition of total factor productivity. The effect of the labour age structure on total factor productivity also shows an inverted `U' shape. Labour between 40 and 49 years old contributes the most to the promotion of total factor productivity. Eventually, due to the low birth rates, the proportion of 50-59 years old will keep at high level. Therefore, total factor productivity will decline significantly.},

This study aimed to investigate the impact of an aerobic exercise intervention based on the capacity, opportunity, motivation-behavior (COM-B) model on physical activity and health-related outcomes in this population. Methods: Thirty-five participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) for an exercise intervention based on the COM-B model, and 33 were assigned to the control group (CG) for usual care. Physical activity levels, daily steps and bone mineral density T-value, body mass index, waist--hip ratio, subendocardial myocardial viability rate, central arterial pressure, growth index, brachial--ankle pulse wave velocity, ankle--arm index were measured at baseline, during the 12-week intervention, and after the 12-week follow-up. Results: Compared with the CG and pre-intervention, total physical activity in the IG increased significantly (P {$<$} 0.05); however, after the 12-week follow-up, total physical activity decreased. At the same time, the average daily steps of the elderly in both groups increased. Compared with the CG, at the 12-week follow-up, the bone mineral density T-value in the IG was significantly improved (P {$<$} 0.05). Compared with the pre-intervention values, during the 12-week intervention, bone mineral density T-value, body mass index, waist--hip ratio, subendocardial myocardial viability rate and central arterial pressure were significantly improved (P {$<$} 0.05); after the 12-week follow-up, brachial--ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle--arm index were significantly improved (P {$<$} 0.05). No statistically significant changes in the growth index were detected, independent of the group and time. Conclusion: Theory-based exercise interventions can change the physical inactivity behavior of older people with chronic diseases, effectively promoting physical activity and improves bone mineral density T-value, controls body weight, and reduces cardiovascular risk and physiological indicators related to atherosclerosis.

However, most location-allocation models emphasize efficiency such as minimal travel burden or maximal demand coverage while omitting the equality issue. This case study optimizes the emergency medical service (EMS) in Shanghai from a trade-off perspective by comparing two models. One is the 2-step optimization (2SO) model that uses the maximum covering location problem (MCLP) to site new facilities and then a quadratic programming (QP) method to optimize capacities, the other performs location selection and capacity optimization simultaneously through greedy optimization (GO). There are several findings from various simulation scenarios. First, the GO model is more effective in optimizing equality, but the 2SO model offers a more balanced approach by covering more people within the mandatory response time while improving access equality. Secondly, solutions of both models change as demands and travel costs vary over time and call for dynamic adjustment of resource allocation. Thirdly, it is important to coordinate EMS with other agencies to ensure reasonable road connectivity and make contingency plans in events such as floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.},

However, prior studies of urban vitality have preferred the demand end of crowd agglomeration to the supply end of commercial businesses, while the refined application of street-view images (SVIs) and the spatial heterogeneity resulting from sectional differences among elements deserve further research. Under this context, this paper took both the alive and the closed storefronts as the objects and developed an analytical framework based on machine learning and SVIs to analyze the characteristics of the streetscape and the economic vitality, followed by a regression analysis between them with a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model. Our findings comprise three aspects: (1) despite the sum of the storefronts being more often used, combining the alive and the closed businesses is beneficial to reflect the real economic vitality; (2) as a reflection of the spatial heterogeneity and sectional differences of elements, the asymmetric streetscape has a significant influence on the economic vitality; and (3) although different factors from the streetscape can influence economic vitality differently, based on varied proxies of the vitality, three factors, namely, higher difference value of the signboards, higher sum of glass interfaces, and lower difference value of the glass interfaces, can benefit the economic vitality. This research can support urban physical examination and the regeneration of old urban districts for urban planners, designers, and decision-makers, and provide new perspectives and proxies as well as a more fine-grained analysis among the traditional studies on economic vitality.},

Results indicate that: (1) the UFZs were identified with an overall accuracy of 0.931, and the industrial and residential zones were the dominated functions in the study area; (2) the GDP gradually decayed from the center to the periphery in the study area and had significant spatial autocorrelation.

Abandoned building detection provides fundamental information for refined urban management, real estate transactions and government decision-making. However, emerging sources of data, such as satellite imagery and commercial street views, are insufficient to timely collect this fine-scale data, lacking large-scale and fine-grained detection method. Therefore, in this research, we aim to define the connotation and identification criteria of abandoned buildings, develop an effective deep learning method based on image segmentation, and detect individual abandoned buildings from large-scale mobile sensing images (MSIs) with high accuracy. The study conducted a mobile sensing campaign in a shrinking city in Northeast China, collecting 11,359 street-level images of 126.2~km of urban roads. The accuracy of the deep learning detection method was 83.8\%. The study compared with the detection of commercial street view images (latest in 2015) and analyzed the dynamic changes of abandoned buildings. From 2015 to 2021, the number of abandoned buildings in the case city decreased from 102 to 50 and became more concentrated in the old city area. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of MSIs in detecting abandoned buildings and shows the enormous potential to timely detect abandoned buildings in large spatial ranges.},

Although the causes leading to this phenomenon have been extensively debated, little granular data are available to evaluate the issue in a timely manner. Therefore, this study aims to develop a data-driven approach to capture the commercial structure of vacant storefronts on a store-by-store basis as well as to analyze their evolution patterns. First, streetlevel images were collected using mobile sensing in a low-cost, large-scale and efficient manner; then, a storefront vacancy estimation model was developed using computer vision techniques to infer the storefront location, operation status, business category, and vacancy rates. Three volunteers spent five days collecting street-level images from an urban area of 964 km2 in the case city of Xining, China. As a result, 93,069 stores were identified in the city in March 2022, of which 25,488 were vacant. Moreover, the storefront vacancy rate increased significantly after the epidemic, from 21.8\% in 2018 to 30.0\% in 2022. Stores in shopping, catering, and life services had the maximum vacancies. The factors that had the greatest impact on storefront vacancy were, in order of importance, far from commercial zonings, low population density, and far from the urban center. However, these factors influenced the vacancy in diverse and complex ways, and in the future, urban planning strategies to address vacancy issues should be well considered and differentiated.},

Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.},

  abstract = {Empirical research provides evidence that, in neighborhoods with higher walkability, individuals make more walking trips. However, it is not clear what the exact nature is of the relationships between neighborhood walkability and walking trips, since a higher walking frequency can be explained in different ways. This study examined whether the extra walking trips in better walkable neighborhoods are related primarily to trip generation, destination choice, or transport mode choice and whether this is the same for different age groups. A neighborhood fixed effects regression analysis was conducted in a first step to obtain a walkability measure for each neighborhood in the Netherlands including systematic as well as unobserved effects. Subsequently, the estimated fixed effects were used as walkability data for a path analysis based on a causal model to test the hypotheses stated. The results of the path analysis show direct relationships of neighborhood walkability with trip generation, destination choice, and transport mode choice, after controlling for the mutual relationships between the activity and trip variables. Comparing different age groups (i.e., children, adults, and elderly), the differences found mostly concerned the relationship between neighborhood walkability and trip generation. We concluded therefore that conditions for walkability are not the same for all age groups.},

The results reveal that there is no statistically significant relationship between subjective greenspace perception and objective greenspace accessibility. In terms of the factors contributing to higher real greenspace usage, we found that males tend to utilize greenspaces more frequently than females, while older individuals exhibit a higher frequency of engagement with greenspaces compared to younger individuals. Subjective greenspace perception emerged as a significant predictor of greenspace usage patterns, indicating the importance of creating attractive, safe, and inclusive greenspaces. However, objective greenspace accessibility did not have a significant correlation with actual greenspace usage, highlighting the importance of perceptions in affecting individual decisions on greenspace usage. These findings provide valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers in creating gender-inclusive and age-friendly greenspaces that meet the diverse needs and preferences of the population, ultimately contributing to the well-being and quality of life in Hong Kong and beyond.},

The main difficulty comes from the uncontrollability of the outdoor environment and the combined effects of various factors such as rain and fog. An importance biased network (IBN) model is proposed to improve the generalization of segmentation models for both hazardous and normal weather. It can adapt its prediction ability according to the severity of the weather, and gives high priority to the importance classes (such as road, person and car) when the conditions are too severe to maintain the accuracy of all classes. Importance biased module uses multibranch decoder to divide the segmentation task into simplified sub-problems, and this divide-and-conquer strategy improves the robustness of the model especially under the severe hazardous conditions; class crosstalk module explicitly represents the sematic-level correlations between the classes, which enhances the information sharing among sub-problems. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Especially for severe weather conditions, 5{\textasciitilde}6\% accuracy improvements have been obtained for the important classes on both synthetic and real data.},

At the moment, there is no fully automatic and high-efficiency atmospheric correction method to make full use of the advantages of geostationary meteorological satellites in large-scale and efficient atmospheric monitoring. Therefore, a QUantitative and Automatic Atmospheric Correction (QUAAC) method is proposed which can efficiently correct high-spatial-resolution (HSR) satellite images. QUAAC uses the atmospheric aerosol products of geostationary satellites to match the synchronized AOD according to the temporal and spatial information of HSR satellite images. This method solves the problem that the AOD is difficult to obtain or the accuracy is not high enough to meet the demand of atmospheric correction. By using the obtained atmospheric parameters, atmospheric correction is performed to obtain the surface reflectance (SR). The whole process can achieve fully automatic operation without manual intervention. After QUAAC applied to Gaofen-2 (GF-2) HSR satellite and Himawari-8 (H-8) geostationary satellite, the results show that the effect of QUAAC correction is slightly better than that of the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) correction, and the QUAAC-corrected surface spectral curves have good coherence to that of the synchronously measured by field experiments.},

The result is compared to that of spatial accessibility via physical visits to care providers based on the popular 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method. The study shows that both spatial and telehealth accessibilities decline from urban to low-density and then rural areas. Moreover, disproportionally higher percentages of African Americans are in areas with higher spatial accessibility scores; but such an advantage is not realized in telehealth accessibility. In the study area, absence of broadband availability is mainly a rural problem and leads to a lower average telehealth accessibility than physical accessibility in rural areas. On the other side, lack of broadband affordability is a challenge across the rural-urban continuum and is disproportionally associated with high concentrations of disadvantaged population groups such as households under the poverty level and Blacks.},

We designed an evaluation index system that includes the six dimensions of population, economy, society, government, environment, and external links by integrating multiple sets of heterogeneous data, and applied it to cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The results show that Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou have the highest vitality levels but are weak regarding their eco-environments. Cities with high vitality are distributed on the Z-shaped key development belt of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration planning. Regional differences in external links and population vitality are significant, and these two dimensions pose weaknesses to many cities. The interregional differences linked to social vitality are the smallest. Vitality not only comes from within the urban system, but also greatly depends on the external environment. The concept ``vital triangle'' and relevant evaluation framework are intended to serve as a basis for future research, and the case study could provide some key decision-making support for urban planning and management.},

  abstract = {New advances in satellite data acquisition and processing offer promise for monitoring agricultural lands globally. Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the ``best'' dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14--58\% and an average of 35\% for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32\% of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Parks provide important physiological and psychological benefits to seniors, improving their quality of life; they are particularly important for low-income, inner-city seniors who lack access to open and green space. However, seniors do not often use parks partly because park design and programming are not responsive to their diverse needs and values. To identify what low-income, inner-city seniors seek and value in neighborhood parks, and to provide guidance to planners on how to better design senior-friendly parks, we conducted a literature review and held focus groups with 39 low-income, ethnically diverse seniors in an inner-city neighborhood in Los Angeles (CA). We asked these seniors about their preferences as well as the challenges and barriers they encounter in using neighborhood parks. Seniors report many impediments to park use; they are not provided appropriate programming that allows opportunities for socializing, safety, and security within the park and along access routes; opportunities for exercise and walking; and aesthetic and natural elements that provide contact with nature. Takeaway for practice: Park planners and designers should seek to incorporate senior voices in park design and programming in four ways by developing appropriate programming sensitive to diverse needs, accommodating the desire for ``seniors-only'' parks, promoting security and safety in the park and along access routes, and offering open and green space. We also find the need for additional research on seniors from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence shows that urban greenspaces have great health benefits, but establishing a causal relationship is difficult. It is often hypothesized that walking and physical activity are mediators in the relationship between urban greenspaces and health outcomes. Furthermore, most urban greenspace--physical activity studies have focused on parks rather than on landscaped streets, even though the latter are the most popular places for physical activity. The lack of research attention for landscaped streets is largely due to the fact that street greenery is difficult to measure, especially at eye level. Using readily available Google Street View images, we developed methods and tools to assess the availability of eye-level street greenery. A two-layered study was developed that 1) examined the association between urban greenspaces and the odds of walking (versus not walking) for 90,445 participants in the Hong Kong Travel Characteristics Survey and 2) carried out sensitivity analysis of the association between urban greenspaces and total walking time for a subset of 6770 participants. Multilevel regression models were developed to reveal the associations between street greenery and walking behaviors while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and other activity-influencing built environment factors, taking into account the inherent clustering within the data. The results showed that both street greenery and the number of parks were associated with higher odds of walking; street greenery but not parks was associated with total walking time. Our results suggest that walking behavior is at least as strongly affected by eye-level street greenery as by parks. They also implicitly support the health benefits of urban greenspaces via walking and physical activity. With the large sample size, our findings pertain to the entire population of Hong Kong. Furthermore, the use of Google Street View is a sound and effective way to assess eye-level greenery, which may benefit further health studies.},

Urban scenes, characterized by numerous elements, intricate arrangement relationships, and vast scale, present a formidable barrier to the interpretability of ambiguous textual descriptions for effective model optimization. In this work, we surmount the limitations by introducing a compositional 3D layout representation into text-to-3D paradigm, serving as an additional prior. It comprises a set of semantic primitives with simple geometric structures and explicit arrangement relationships, complementing textual descriptions and enabling steerable generation. Upon this, we propose two modifications -- (1) We introduce Layout-Guided Variational Score Distillation to address model optimization inadequacies. It conditions the score distillation sampling process with geometric and semantic constraints of 3D layouts. (2) To handle the unbounded nature of urban scenes, we represent 3D scene with a Scalable Hash Grid structure, incrementally adapting to the growing scale of urban scenes. Extensive experiments substantiate the capability of our framework to scale text-to-3D generation to large-scale urban scenes that cover over 1000m driving distance for the first time. We also present various scene editing demonstrations, showing the powers of steerable urban scene generation. Website: https://urbanarchitect.github.io.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

The traditional designation methods are primarily regional availability measures, which use administrative boundaries such as counties as the basic spatial units for calculating physician to population ratios and designate shortage based on those ratios. Such approaches have been criticized for their inability to account for either the spatial variations of population demand and physician supply within those boundaries or for population-physician interactions across them. The floating catchment method addresses the internal spatial distribution problem by deriving population data from a smaller unit, the census tract. The potential cross border patient--physician interaction is taken into consideration by using circles of reasonable radius around each census tract centroid as the basic spatial units, which can encompass areas on either side of an administrative border. By varying the radius of the catchment circle, this paper demonstrates that the physician to population ratio is scale dependent and that the greatest variability of the ratios and shortages occur at the most local scales ({$<$} 20 miles), which argues for using finer spatial resolution data in shortage designation practice.},

But the demographic transition paradigm that has been very useful for explaining global demographic trends during the 20th century and that still has strong predictive power when it comes to projecting future trends in countries that still have high fertility, has nothing to say about the future of fertility in Europe. The currently popular notion of a `second demographic transition' is a useful way to describe a bundle of behavioural and normative changes that recently happened in Europe, but it has no predictive power. The social sciences have not yet come up with a useful theory to predict the future fertility level of post-demographic transition societies. We even do not know whether the trend will be up or down. Given the lack of a predictive theory, this paper will try to do two things: (i) Summarize different substantive arguments that would either suggest the assumption of a recovery of fertility rates in Europe or alternatively, imply further declines. (ii) Convert this discussion of the uncertainty of future fertility trends into probabilistic population projections for Europe, thus highlighting the implications of alternative fertility levels over the coming years. We will also discuss trade-offs between fertility and immigration, and the phenomenon that Europe now has entered a period of negative momentum of population growth.},

Therefore, this study classified 315 Chinese cities according to their economic and industrial structure by SOM-K-means, aiming to evaluate the trends and dynamic drivers of carbon peaking progress in different city types. The findings reveal a decline in carbon emissions in 110 cities (34.9~\%) since 2020. Notably, all city types show potential for carbon reduction and achieving carbon peaking. Specifically, resource-based cities and high-end service cities have the most effect on reducing emissions, with 48.4~\% and 42.1~\% of the cities declining in carbon emissions. Energy-based and heavy industrial cities face heightened pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, in high-end service cities, energy efficiency and investment intensity contribute to emission reduction, while industrial structure adjustment decrease carbon emissions in resource-based cities. Furthermore, enhancing energy efficiency effects and R\&D intensity are effective ways to significantly reduce carbon emissions in heavy industrial cities. We conclude that differentiating carbon reduction pathways for different cities should constitute be a breakthrough in achieving the goal of carbon peaking. These insights provide recommendations for cities that have yet to reach their carbon peak for both China and other developing countries.},

By virtue of a million intensively collected panoramic street view images in Shenzhen, China, the image-segmentation technique SegNet automatically extracts pixelwise semantical information and classifies visual elements. The throughput of the eye-level perception of the street canyon is formed by five indices. Additionally, the framework-derived scores (FDSs) are contrasted with the subjective rating scores (SRSs) to report the divergence and coherence between the visually experienced and the quantitative estimated methods. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial heterogeneity of five perception aspects, discuss the variations of the perception outcomes across different function streets, and analyze the net effect of urban renewal projects (URPs) on streetscape transformation. We conclude that this deep learning-driven approach provides a feasible paradigm to depict high-resolution streetscape perception, to analyze fine-scale built environment, and to effectively bridge gaps between the street semantic metric and urban renewal.},

The results show a significant and positive relationship between the higher density of Airbnb lodgings and the higher crime rates in the neighbourhoods, especially of patrimonial nature. Divided by type of leased space, the Airbnb homes, in which the guest shares a room with other guests, show a higher relationship with crimes against property and people.

  abstract = {Urban vacant land is a growing issue worldwide. However, most of the existing research on urban vacant land has focused on small-scale city areas, while few studies have focused on large-scale national areas. Large-scale identification of urban vacant land is hindered by the disadvantage of high cost and high variability when using the conventional manual identification method. Criteria inconsistency in cross-domain identification is also a major challenge. To address these problems, we propose a large-scale automatic identification framework of urban vacant land based on semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images and select 36 major cities in China as study areas. The framework utilizes deep learning techniques to realize automatic identification and introduces the city stratification method to address the challenge of identification criteria inconsistency. The results of the case study on 36 major Chinese cities indicate two major conclusions. First, the proposed framework of vacant land identification can achieve over 90 percent accuracy of the level of professional auditors with much higher result stability and approximately 15 times higher efficiency compared to the manual identification method. Second, the framework has strong robustness and can maintain high performance in various cities. With the above advantages, the proposed framework provides a practical approach to large-scale vacant land identification in various countries and regions worldwide, which is of great significance for the academic development of urban vacant land and future urban development.},

  abstract = {In the field of earth observation (EO), continual learning (CL) algorithms have been proposed to deal with large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets and processing them incrementally. The majority of these algorithms assume that data are, first, coming from a single source, and second, fully labeled. Real-world EO datasets are instead characterized by a large heterogeneity (e.g., coming from aerial, satellite, or drone scenarios), and for the most part they are unlabeled, meaning they can be fully exploited only through the emerging self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm. For these reasons, in this article, we present a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing applications that we call continual Barlow twins. It combines the advantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow twins, with the elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we evaluate the proposed continual SSL approach on a highly heterogeneous EO dataset, showing the effectiveness of this strategy on a novel combination of three almost non-overlapping domains datasets (airborne Potsdam, satellite US3D, and drone unmanned aerial vehicle semantic segmentation dataset), on a crucial downstream task in EO, i.e., semantic segmentation. Encouraging results show the superiority of SSL in this setting, and the effectiveness of creating an incremental effective pretrained feature extractor, based on ResNet50, without the need of relying on the complete availability of all the data, with a valuable saving of time and resources.},

It has been documented in a large literature analyzing the social and economic issues that have led to population flight, resulting, in the worse cases, in the eventual abandonment of blocks of housing and neighbourhoods. Analysis of urban shrinkage should take into account the new realization that this phenomenon is now global and multidimensional --- but also little understood in all its manifestations. Thus, as the world's population increasingly becomes urban, orthodox views of urban decline need redefinition. The symposium includes articles from 10 urban analysts working on 30 cities around the globe. These analysts belong to the Shrinking Cities International Research Network (SCIRN), whose collaborative work aims to understand different types of city shrinkage and the role that different approaches, policies and strategies have played in the regeneration of these cities. In this way the symposium will inform both a rich diversity of analytical perspectives and country-based studies of the challenges faced by shrinking cities. It will also disseminate SCIRN's research results from the last 3 years.                                         R{\'e}sum{\'e}                                La d{\'e}croissance urbaine n'est pas un ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne nouveau.

The questionnaire included socioeconomic status, self-rated health, medical history, depressive symptoms, instrumental activities of daily living and social participation. We used the Walk Score{\textregistered} as neighborhood walkability and a walk score {$<$}50 was categorized as a ``car-dependent'' area and a score {$\geq$}50 as a ``walkable'' area. A Poisson regression analysis stratified by sex was performed to investigate the association of neighborhood walkability with social participation. Prevalence ratios were calculated and their 95\% confidence intervals. Results We found that dwelling in car-dependent areas (prevalence ratio 0.78, 95\% confidence interval 0.64--0.94) had a significant negative effect on women's social participation, unlike men. Conclusions Our study showed that neighborhood walkability and social participation were associated with older Japanese women after adjusting for the covariates.

This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective.

The personal desire for intimacy and individuation through family relationships remains strong. In their support or promotion of social liberalism and economic deregulation, often through legislation, states have been principal players in the higher risks now associated with family life. Individual preferences are formed in the shadow of the social and economic institutions of the society. The shape of these institutions is within the realm of political choice.

Results Neighborhood-level disorder, but not social cohesion, was significantly associated with walking, independent individual-level neighborhood perceptions and other correlates of walking. Further adjustment for race weakened this association to a marginally significant level. Discussion Neighborhood conditions may shape walking behavior in older adults, especially conditions that reflect physical neglect or social threat. Promotion of walking behavior in older adults may require improvement of the safety and upkeep of the neighborhood environment.},

  abstract = {Background A large body of research shows that social isolation and loneliness have detrimental health consequences. Identifying individuals at risk of social isolation or loneliness is, therefore, important. The objective of this study was to examine personal (e.g., sex, income) and geographic (rural/urban and sociodemographic) factors and their association with social isolation and loneliness in a national sample of Canadians aged 45 to 85 years. Methods The study involved cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging that were linked to 2016 census data at the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) level. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between personal factors and geographic factors and social isolation and loneliness for the total sample, and women and men, respectively. Results The prevalence of social isolation and loneliness was 5.1\% and 10.2\%, respectively, but varied substantially across personal characteristics. Personal characteristics (age, sex, education, income, functional impairment, chronic diseases) were significantly related to both social isolation and loneliness, although some differences emerged in the direction of the relationships for the two measures. Associations also differed somewhat for women versus men. Associations between some geographic factors emerged for social isolation, but not loneliness. Living in an urban core was related to increased odds of social isolation, an effect that was no longer significant when FSA-level factors were controlled for. FSAs with a higher percentage of 65+ year old residents with low income were consistently associated with higher odds of social isolation. Conclusion The findings indicate that socially isolated individuals are, to some extent, clustered into areas with a high proportion of low-income older adults, suggesting that support and resources could be targeted at these areas. For loneliness, the focus may be less on where people live, but rather on personal characteristics that place individuals at risk.},

  abstract = {Shrinking cities have spread across the globe in recent decades, characterizing significant population loss, economic decline, and decay in spatial quality. To maintain global economic prosperity in the context of urban shrinkage and support decision making in the direction, it is necessary to accurately identify shrinking cities on a global scale. We utilize redefined natural city boundaries and the LandScan dataset to identify and map shrinking cities experiencing population loss on the globe. As a result, we have identified 5004 shrinking cities worldwide, with a total area of 126,930\>km2 during 2000--2019. The ratio of which in number and in area is 27\% and 22\%, respectively. The shrinking cities are clustered and mainly located in Europe, Eastern Asia, and northeastern United States. There are 41 countries with more than 20 shrinking cities on the globe. The number of shrinking cities in China reached 679, which is the most. Among the 41 countries, the median value of the natural cities' shrinking ratios of Iraq, Iran, Austria, South Africa, Russia, Georgia, and Belarus is {$>$}50\%, indicating that the urban population loss in these countries is relatively serious. Our findings can be used to inform decision makers and urban planners to adjust the ``growth-oriented'' planning paradigm and adopt precise strategies, to form a healthier urban development.},

  abstract = {Background: Using data from the SHAPE trial, a randomized 6-month neighborhood-based intervention designed to increase walking activity among older adults, this study identified and analyzed social-ecological factors mediating and moderating changes in walking activity. Methods: Three potential mediators (social cohesion, walking efficacy, and perception of neighborhood problems) and minutes of brisk walking were assessed at baseline, 3-months, and 6months. One moderator, neighborhood walkability, was assessed using an administrative GIS database. The mediating effect of change in process variables on change in brisk walking was tested using a product-of-coefficients test, and we evaluated the moderating effect of neighborhood walkability on change in brisk walking by testing the significance of the interaction between walkability and intervention status. Results: Only one of the hypothesized mediators, walking efficacy, explained the intervention effect (product of the coefficients (95\% CI) = 8.72 (2.53, 15.56). Contrary to hypotheses, perceived neighborhood problems appeared to suppress the intervention effects (product of the coefficients (95\% CI = -2.48, -5.6, -0.22). Neighborhood walkability did not moderate the intervention effect. Conclusion: Walking efficacy may be an important mediator of lay-lead walking interventions for sedentary older adults. Social-ecologic theory-based analyses can support clinical interventions to elucidate the mediators and moderators responsible for producing intervention effects.},

Various approaches, including observation and simulation techniques, have been proposed to understand the causes of UHI formation and to find the corresponding mitigation strategies. However, the causes of UHI are not the same in different climates or city features. Thus, general conclusion cannot be made based on limited monitoring data. With recent progress in computational tools, simulation methods have been used to study UHI. These approaches, however, are also not able to cover all the phenomena that simultaneously contribute to the formation of UHI. The shortcomings are mostly attributed to the weakness of the theories and computational cost. This paper presents a review of the techniques used to study UHI. The abilities and limitations of each approach for the investigation of UHI mitigation and prediction are discussed. Treatment of important parameters including latent, sensible, storage, and anthropogenic heat in addition to treatment of radiation, effect of trees and pond, and boundary condition to simulate UHI is also presented. Finally, this paper discusses the application of integration approach as a future opportunity.},

  abstract = {The ``15-minute city'' concept has been receiving an increasing amount of attention as a model for urban policy as well as a tool for urban spatial analysis. The concept is often considered an urban planning ideal that can effectively contribute to improved accessibility and a more sustainable mobility. Through a sustainability, equity, and livability lens, this paper examines pitfalls of the 15-minute city from a theoretical and spatial analysis perspective and proposes alternative theoretical and methodological directions. The seven pitfalls of the 15-minute city in current literature are summarized as: (1) overstatement of the 15-minute city's originality, (2) strong decentralization proposed by the 15-minute city theory is unrealistic and unsustainable, (3) focusing on quantity of destinations instead of sufficiency, (4) improperly aggregating facilities, (5) neglecting diverse forms of nature and their characteristics, (6) disregarding public transport in 15-minute city theory or spatial analysis, and (7) ignoring interpersonal differences in walking and cycling when conducting analyses based on the 15-minute city. A set of strategies is proposed to address these pitfalls and reorient the 15-minute city towards improved environmental and societal outcomes.},

We tested McAuley's social-cognitive model of the PA--QOL relationship in the cultural context of the Czech Republic, a post-communist central European country. A total of 546 older Czech adults (mean age 68~years) completed a battery of questionnaires assessing indicators of PA, self-efficacy, health status, and global QOL. A structural equation model was used to test the relationship between PA and QOL. The model hypothesized an indirect relationship between PA and QOL: PA predicted self-efficacy, which in turn predicted global QOL through mental and physical health status. The analyses indicated an acceptable fit of the proposed model, albeit with different emphases than those of studies from Western countries. Above all, we observed a stronger effect of PA on self-efficacy and a weaker mediating effect of health status on the PA--QOL relationship. Our findings supported the validity of McAuley's PA--QOL social-cognitive model for a non-Western cultural context. However, it seems that self-efficacy and health status may influence the PA--QOL relationship in this population in a manner different from that proposed in McAuley's model.},

This research, however, will not dwell on the issue of capacity based on the number of demands and available schools, but rather the accessibility and fairness. Two methods: radius and road network, are used in this research with the addition of spatial analysis to measure the students' walking accessibility level relating to the school zoning system regulations in Indonesia. The analysis result highlighted the variations in accuracy between the two methods, the coverage area between formal and informal settlements, and the spatial context of the accessibility.

  abstract = {Floods are a major cause of loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure, and massive damage to a country's economy. Floods, being natural disasters, cannot be prevented completely; therefore, precautionary measures must be taken by the government, concerned organizations such as the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and Office for the coordination of Human Affairs, and the community to control its disastrous effects. To minimize hazards and to provide an emergency response at the time of natural calamity, various measures must be taken by the disaster management authorities before the flood incident. This involves the use of the latest cutting-edge technologies which predict the occurrence of disaster as early as possible such that proper response strategies can be adopted before the disaster. Floods are uncertain depending on several climatic and environmental factors, and therefore are difficult to predict. Hence, improvement in the adoption of the latest technology to move towards automated disaster prediction and forecasting is a must. This study reviews the adoption of remote sensing methods for predicting floods and thus focuses on the pre-disaster phase of the disaster management process for the past 20 years. A classification framework is presented which classifies the remote sensing technologies being used for flood prediction into three types, which are: multispectral, radar, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Further categorization is performed based on the method used for data analysis. The technologies are examined based on their relevance to flood prediction, flood risk assessment, and hazard analysis. Some gaps and limitations present in each of the reviewed technologies have been identified. A flood prediction and extent mapping model are then proposed to overcome the current gaps. The compiled results demonstrate the state of each technology's practice and usage in flood prediction.},

  abstract = {Abstract 抽象的 Objective People who spend a longer time walking have lower demands for medical care. However, in view of their longer life expectancy, it is unclear whether their lifetime medical expenditure increases or decreases. The present study examined the association between time spent walking, life expectancy and lifetime medical expenditure.目的步行时间较长的人对医疗的需求较低。然而，鉴于他们的预期寿命较长，目前还不清楚他们的终生医疗支出是增加还是减少。本研究调查了步行时间、预期寿命和终生医疗支出之间的关系。 Method The authors followed up 27 738 participants aged 40--79 years and prospectively collected data on their medical expenditure and survival covering a 13-year-period. Participants were classified into those walking {$<$}1 and {$\geq$}1 h per day. The authors constructed life tables and estimated the life expectancy and lifetime medical expenditure from 40 years of age using estimate of multiadjusted mortality and medical expenditure using a Poisson regression model and linear regression model, respectively.方法作者对 27 738 名年龄在 40-79 岁的参与者进行了随访，前瞻性地收集了他们 13 年期间的医疗支出和生存数据。参与者被分为每天步行{$<$}1 小时和{$\geq$}1 小时的两组。作者构建了生命表，并分别使用泊松回归模型和线性回归模型估计了多重调整死亡率和医疗支出，估计了 40 岁起的预期寿命和终生医疗支出。 Results Participants who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day have a longer life expectancy from 40 years of age than participants who walked {$<$}1 h per day. The multiadjusted life expectancy for those who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day was 44.81 years, significantly lower by 1.38 years in men (p=0.0073) in men and 57.78 years in women, non-significantly lower by 1.16 years in women (p=0.2351). In addition to their longer life expectancy, participants who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day required a lower lifetime medical expenditure from 40 years of age than participants who walked {$<$}1 h per day. The multiadjusted lifetime medical expenditure for those who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day was {\pounds}99 423.6, significantly lower by 7.6\% in men (p=0.0048) and {\pounds}128 161.2, non-significantly lower by 2.7\% in women (p=0.2559).结果每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的参与者从 40 岁起的预期寿命比每天步行 {$<$}1 小时的参与者更长。每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的人的多重调整预期寿命为 44.81 岁，男性显着降低 1.38 岁 (p=0.0073)，女性为 57.78 岁，女性非显着降低 1.16 岁 (p=0.2351) ）。除了预期寿命更长外，每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的参与者比每天步行 {$<$}1 小时的参与者从 40 岁起需要的终生医疗支出更低。每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的患者经多重调整后的终生医疗支出为 99 423.6 英镑，男性显着降低 7.6\% (p=0.0048)，女性为 128 161.2 英镑，非显着降低 2.7\% (p=0.2559) 。 Discussion Increased longevity resulting from a healthier lifestyle does not necessarily translate into an increased amount of medical expenditure throughout life. Encouraging people to walk may extend life expectancy and decrease lifetime medical expenditure, especially for men.讨论更健康的生活方式带来的寿命延长并不一定意味着一生中医疗支出的增加。鼓励人们步行可以延长预期寿命并减少终生医疗支出，特别是对于男性而言。},

  abstract = {In recent years, the size of many social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn has exploded at a rapid pace, because of its convenience in using the internet in order to connect geographically disparate users. This has lead to considerable interest in many graph-theoretical aspects of social networks such as the underlying communities, the graph diameter, and other structural information which can be used in order to mine useful information from the social network. The graph structure of social networks is influenced by the underlying social behavior, which can vary considerably over different groups of individuals. One of the disadvantages of existing schemes is that they attempt to determine global communities, which (implicitly) assume uniform behavior over the network. This is not very well suited to the differences in the underlying density in different regions of the social network. As a result, a global analysis over social community structure can result in either very small communities (in sparse regions), or communities which are too large and incoherent (in dense regions). In order to handle the challenge of local heterogeneity, we will explore a simple property of social networks, which we refer to as the local succinctness property. We will use this property in order to extract compressed descriptions of the underlying community representation of the social network with the use of a min-hash approach. We will show that this approach creates balanced communities across a heterogeneous network in an effective way. We apply the approach to a variety of data sets, and illustrate its effectiveness over competing techniques.},

However, previous studies have only considered limited types of subjective perceptions, neglecting the relationships between them. Further, accurately measuring subjective perception with low computational costs for large-scale urban regions at high spatial resolutions has been difficult. We present a deep-learning-based multilabel classification model that can measure 22 subjective perceptions scores from street-view images. This model uses the results of a web questionnaire survey encompassing 22 subjective perceptions, with 8.8 million responses. Our model demonstrates high accuracy (0.80--0.91) in measuring subjective perception scores from street-view images and achieves low computational cost by training on 22 subjective perception relationships. The 22 subjective perceptions were analyzed using PCA and k-means analysis. By categorizing the 22 subjective perceptions into a two-dimensional space visualized and grouped into distinct groups---positive, negative, calm, and lively---we unearthed vital insights into the intricate nuances of human perception. In addition, the study used semantic segmentation to extract landscape elements from street-view images and applied {$\ell$}1-regularized sparse modeling to identify the landscape elements structurally correlating with each subjective perception class. The analysis revealed that only seven out of nineteen landscape elements significantly correlated with subjective impressions, and these effects varied by class. Notably, sky coverage positively influences positive subjective perceptions, such as attractiveness and calmness, but negatively affects lively impressions. The proposed model can be used to map the overall image of a city and identify landscape design issues in community development design.},

There is increasing interest in examining the role of the built environment in shaping patterns of physical activity. However, few studies have: (1) simultaneously examined physical activity for leisure and utility; (2) selected study areas with a range of built environment characteristics; and (3) assessed the built environment using high-resolution land use data. Methods: Data on individuals used for this study are from a survey of 1602 adults in selected sites across suburban Metro Vancouver. Four types of physical activity were assessed: walking to work/school, walking for errands, walking for leisure and moderate physical activity for exercise. The built environment was assessed by constructing one-kilometre road network buffers around each respondent's postal code. Measures of the built environment include terciles of recreational and park land, residential land, institutional land, commercial land and land use mix. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that walking to work/school and moderate physical activity were not associated with any built environment measure. Living in areas with lower land use mix, lower commercial and lower recreational land increased the odds of low levels of walking for errands. Individuals living in the lower third of land use mix and institutional land were more likely to report low levels of walking for leisure. Conclusions: These results suggest that walking for errands and leisure have a greater association with the built environment than other dimensions of physical activity.},

  abstract = {Background: Among older people, walking is a popular and prevalent activity. Walking is key to increasing physical activity levels and resulting physical and mental health. In the context of rapidly ageing populations, it is important to better understand what factors are associated with walking among older people, based on the socioecological model of health. Methods: We used data from Understanding Society (n:6450), a national panel survey of UK adults aged 65 years and over living in Great Britain. Slope Indices of Inequality (SII) were calculated for weekly walking hours for older people according to individual, social and area characteristics. These include health, loneliness and social isolation, previous walking and sporting activity, residential self-selection, contact with neighbours, number of close friends and social activity. Spatial area-level data described local area crime, walkability, and proximity to retail, greenspace, and public transport amenities. Results: Multivariable models indicated that poor health, particularly requiring help with walking, was the strongest predictor of weekly walking hours (SII (95\% CI) comparing those needing help vs. no help: 3.58 ( 4.30, 2.87)). However, both prior sporting activity (most vs. least active: 2.30 (1.75, 2.88)) and walking for pleasure (yes vs. no: 1.92 (1.32, 2.53)) were strongly associated with increased walking several years later. Similarly having close friends (most vs. fewest, 1.18 (0.72, 1.77)) and local retail destinations (any vs. none: 0.93 (0.00, 1.86)) were associated with more weekly walking. Conclusions: Past engagement in physical activity and walking for pleasure are strong predictors of walking behaviour in older people, underscoring the importance of implementing and sustaining walking interventions across the lifespan to ensure continued engagement in later years and the associated health benefits. However, poor health significantly impedes walking in this demographic, emphasising the need for interventions that offer both physical assistance and social support to promote this activity.},

The purpose of this guide is to engage cities to become more age-friendly so as to tap the potential that older people represent for humanity. Working with groups in 33 cities, WHO asked older people in focus groups to describe the advantages and barriers they experience in eight areas of city living. In most cities, the reports from older people were complemented by evidence from focus groups of caregivers and service providers in the public, voluntary and private sectors. The results from the focus groups led to the development of a this set of age-friendly city checklists.

This will require a transformation of health systems away from disease based curative models and towards the provision of older-person-centred and integrated care. It will require the development sometimes from nothing of comprehensive systems of long term care. It will require a coordinated response from many other sectors and multiple levels of government. And it will need to draw on better ways of measuring and monitoring the health and functioning of older populations. These actions are likely to be a sound investment in society's future. A future that gives older people the freedom to live lives that previous generations might never have imagined. The World report on ageing and health responds to these challenges by recommending equally profound changes in the way health policies for ageing populations are formulated and services are provided. As the foundation for its recommendations the report looks at what the latest evidence has to say about the ageing process noting that many common perceptions and assumptions about older people are based on outdated stereotypes. The report's recommendations are anchored in the evidence comprehensive and forward-looking yet eminently practical. Throughout examples of experiences from different countries are used to illustrate how specific problems can be addressed through innovation solutions. Topics explored range from strategies to deliver comprehensive and person-centred services to older populations to policies that enable older people to live in comfort and safety to ways to correct the problems and injustices inherent in current systems for long-term care.},

Walking is the most common physical activity behavior of adults; environmental innovations may be able to influence rates of participation. Method Review of studies on relationships of objectively assessed and perceived environmental attributes with walking. Associations with environmental attributes were examined separately for exercise and recreational walking, walking to get to and from places, and total walking. Results Eighteen studies were identified. Aesthetic attributes, convenience of facilities for walking (sidewalks, trails); accessibility of destinations (stores, park, beach); and perceptions about traffic and busy roads were found to be associated with walking for particular purposes. Attributes associated with walking for exercise were different from those associated with walking to get to and from places. Conclusions While few studies have examined specific environment--walking relationships, early evidence is promising. Key elements of the research agenda are developing reliable and valid measures of environmental attributes and walking behaviors, determining whether environment--behavior relationships are causal, and developing theoretical models that account for environmental influences and their interactions with other determinants.},

It brought together urban and regional planners, architects, engineers, developers, artists, and academics to examine the perspectives of a largely underrepresented topic: shrinking cities.The Future of Shrinking Cities: Problems, Patterns, and Strategies of Urban Transformation in a Global Context presents research carried out under the aegis of the Shrinking Cities International Research Network (SCiRN) and -- in addition -- selected case studies from the United States. The purpose of the publication is to encourage and inform discussion to improve the quality of life in shrinking cities. The authors identify and examine critical projects and issues in shrinking cities and present lessons learned from relevant projects and experiences in the US and abroad. The comparative approach to shrinking cities, incorporating a wide range of case studies in order to widen the debate, is both unique and innovative.The shrinking city phenomenon is a multidimensional process, comprising cities, parts of cities, or entire metropolitan areas that have experienced dramatic decline in their economic and social bases. Thus, urban shrinkage is often a challenge on the wide scale of metropolitan regions and requires policy-makers to redefine traditional paths of regional governance. Urban decline and the loss of employment opportunities are closely linked in a downward spiral, leading to an out-migration of population.The joint work places shrinking cities in a global perspective, setting the context for in-depth comparisons of selected cities considering specific social, economic, environmental, cultural, and land-use issues. Especially in the United States, planning practice is to a large extent concentrated on either managing urban growth or tackling redevelopment in a fragmented -- not a regional -- way, despite the fact that in many metropolitan regions urban shrinkage reaches beyond individual cities. In this regard, the papers will help initiate a redefinition of regional governance in the U.S. and also in the other participating countries via comparative research on shrinking cities.Karina Pallagst et al (eds.)

However, limited studies have examined its association with sarcopenia in older adults. Thus, this study aimed to examine the association between neighborhood walk score and risks of sarcopenia in a sample of older Taiwanese adults. Design and setting: This study was a cross-sectional investigation using telephone-based survey. Participants: A nationwide telephonebased survey targeting older adults ({$\geq$} 65 years) was conducted in Taiwan. Measurements: Data on neighborhood walkability (determined by walk score of residential neighborhood), sarcopenia scores (measured by SARC-F), and personal characteristics were obtained. The relationships between walk score and risks of sarcopenia were examined using generalized additive models. Results: A total of 1,056 older adults participated in the survey. In model 1 (sex and age) and model 2 (full-adjusted model), a nonlinear association between neighborhood walk score and risks of sarcopenia was observed. Results showed that risks of sarcopenia appear to be lower in neighborhoods with a 40-walk score (Car-Dependent; most errands require a car) and an 80-walk score (Very Walkable) and highest in the neighborhood with a 60-walk score (Somewhat Walkable). Conclusions: The study revealed a nonlinear relationship between neighborhood walkability and risks of sarcopenia in older adults in Asian context. Results provided information to urban designers and public health practitioners that more walkable neighborhood may not necessarily protect older adults from risks of sarcopenia.},

Forest fire has a devastating impact over the environment, landscape, and ecological succession. Every year entire globe witnesses a large number of forest fires. In the foothills of the Indian Himalayan region (Shivalik), periodical spatial and severity of forest fires varies, as fires in these areas are often associated with a large concentration of pine needles on the forest floor. Thereby, forest fire assessment and mapping is very important to minimize the effect and frequency of fire events. Monitoring forest fire over large area has become cost and time effective by using remote sensing imageries (spaceborne or airborne). Remote sensing is one of the most important tools to study and detecting forest fires in cases. Global as well as periodic coverage of remote sensing data have replaced the traditional methods of fire detection to a huge extent. Remote sensing approaches help to analyze wide scenario and factors that affect forest fire. Availability of a wide range of fire detection sensors like MODIS, VIIRS, Sentinel, and so on provide us with plenty of options for mapping forest fire severity and provide mitigation. Various indices like normalized burned ratio, normalized burned thermal ratio, burned area index are most commonly used for forest fire severity mapping. The present chapter provides an overview on advancements in remote sensing techniques which can be used to map the fire incidence.},

Socio-ecological models suggest that weather conditions are determinants of PA and may bias relations between other environmental factors and PA. This may especially be the case for the most vulnerable and inactive older persons. Understanding the role of weather conditions is based on daily or seasonal variation in weather, but it can be improved by using hour-to-hour measured weather conditions.Purpose: to study the hour-to-hour relationships between weather factors and objectively measured walking and cycling in a sample of Dutch older adults.Methods: baseline data (2013) of a sub-sample of older adults (3,248 observations clustered in 43 adults) participating in The Neighborhood Walking in Rotterdam Older ADultS (NEW.ROADS) trial were used. Participants wore a GPS logger for 7 consecutive days. Hour-to-hour weather data (temperature, wind speed, rain and sun time) for the city of Rotterdam were retrieved from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Multilevel linear regression models were fitted with minutes walked and minutes cycled as dependent variables and the weather variables as independent variables.Results: the time older adults walked increased with higher temperature, higher wind speed and the absence of rain. The time cycled increased with higher temperature.Conclusions: this study improves the evidence of weather factors as a determinant for walking and cycling in older adults. Studies on the relation between environmental factors and PA should consider adjustment for weather factors.},

The study utilized a modern machine learning computer vision algorithm in the urban build environment to simulate the process, which starts with the visual perception of the urban street landscape and ends with the human reaction to street vitality. By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality's visual features and evaluate their importance. A region around the Mochou Lake in Nanjing, China, was set as our study area. Seven investigators surveyed the area, recorded their evaluation score on each site's vitality level with a corresponding picture taken on site. A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process. Applying the trained model in urban planning practices can help to improve the city environment for better attraction of residents' activities and communications.},

We proposed a conceptual framework to examine the effect of human perception on walking behavior by integrating travel trajectories from the ``big data'' derived from mobile phones and ``small data'' obtained from a questionnaire survey of residents living in Chengdu, China. Results show that the human subjective perceived environment is inconsistent with the objectively measured built environment. The walking behavior of individuals is completely regulated by their personal perception of the surrounding environment. Moreover, enhancing the environmental design of pathways leading to retail shops, recreational areas, and shopping centers could significantly enhance perceived accessibility and foster a more pedestrian-friendly neighborhood.},

  abstract = {Houses with better street design are found to relate to a price premium. Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue that objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers' perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like ``human scale'' showed stronger strength than commonly studied ``safety'' and ``enclosure''. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like ``person'' and ``fence'' outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. Correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans.},

Within this trend, most studies took an objective approach by extracting streetscape pixels to directly proxy human perceptions. Less studies addressed the strength of the subjective perceptions measured from visual surveys. We argue that human perception is a subjective and subtle sensory process that cannot be fully captured using objective indicators. We hypothesize that the subjective approach could provide stronger predictive power to housing prices. Taking Shanghai as a case study, we extend a spatial HPM with both subjectively-measured and objectively-derived perceptions of six urban design qualities. Accounting for the spatial dependence, subjective scores collectively explained equal price variance, while all their individual signs were opposite to the objective counterparts. Moreover, most subjective scores individually exhibited stronger strength, confirming our hypothesis that perceptions are better captured using subjective measures. For ambiguous concepts such as imageability, the subjective framework exhibits better performance, while the objective constructs are more effective to represent straightforward perceptions like greenness and enclosure. This study contributes to the studies on the coherence and divergence of subjective and objective measures of perceptions and environmental qualities. It enriches the literature on the economic values of streetscapes and provides guidance on the indicator selection for assessing, designing, and managing street environments.},

  abstract = {Anomaly segmentation is a critical task for driving applications, and it is approached traditionally as a perpixel classification problem. However, reasoning individually about each pixel without considering their contextual semantics results in high uncertainty around the objects' boundaries and numerous false positives. We propose a paradigm change by shifting from a per-pixel classification to a mask classification. Our mask-based method, Mask2Anomaly, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating an anomaly detection method in a mask-classification architecture. Mask2Anomaly includes several technical novelties that are designed to improve the detection of anomalies in masks: i) a global masked attention module to focus individually on the foreground and background regions; ii) a mask contrastive learning that maximizes the margin between an anomaly and known classes; and iii) a mask refinement solution to reduce false positives. Mask2Anomaly achieves new state-of-the-art results across a range of benchmarks, both in the per-pixel and component-level evaluations. In particular, Mask2Anomaly reduces the average false positives rate by 60\% w.r.t. the previous stateof-the-art.},

We explore the association between neighborhood walkability and respondents' perception of their independence, quality of life, and likelihood of needing to move in the future. We find that those living in walkable neighborhoods believe that they will maintain their lifestyle when they stop driving compared to those who live in less walkable areas.

Purpose The goal of the study was to examine the association between walkability and physical activity outcomes, and the effect of income on the relationship between walkability and physical activity in adults. Methods The Spaces for Physical Activity in Adults Study (ESPACOS Project) took place in Curitiba, Brazil. Data were collected in 2010 in 32 census tracts selected to vary in income and walkability, as measured by GIS. Participants were 697 individuals aged 18--65 years (52.0\% were women) randomly sampled from the selected neighborhoods. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to measure physical activity. All analyses were conducted in 2012. Results The proportion of those who walked for transportation for {$\geq$}150 minutes/week was 21.1\% in low-walkability areas, and ranged from 33.5\% to 35.0\% in high-walkability areas. A total of 12.6\% of residents were found to walk for leisure for {$\geq$}150 minutes/week; this result did not vary across quadrants of walkability and income level. The prevalence of leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 7.1--10.5 percentage points higher in high-compared to low-walkability areas. After adjusting for all individual confounders, walkability showed an independent association with walking for transport (OR=2.10, 95\% CI=1.31, 3.37, p=0.002) and leisure-time MVPA (OR=1.57; 95\% CI=1.06, 2.32; p=0.024). Neighborhood income level was independently associated with leisure-time MVPA (OR=1.70; 95\% CI=1.06, 2.74, p=0.029). No association was found between walkability and walking for leisure. No interaction was found between walkability and neighborhood income level. Conclusions This study, among adults living in Curitiba, Brazil, confirms findings from studies of high-income countries showing that walkability is positively associated with physical activity. People living in high-walkability areas were more likely to be physically active regardless of their neighborhood income level.},

It argues that the demographic evolution of cities is not adequately explained by the `stages of urban development' model that tends to consider urban regions as closed systems. It should rather be analysed by unfolding the underlying mechanisms that include housing consumption as well as in- and out-migration flows. Swiss cities have gained inhabitants since 2000 thanks to international migrants, young adults, non-family households and some parts of the middle to upper class. From a demographic point of view, families' residential behaviour remains the driving force of suburbanisation so that the population growth is still higher in suburbs than in cities.},

We apply classical and spatial Markov chains to measure spatial income dynamics and we employ a decomposition of spatial inequality to measure spatial polarization. In doing so, we ask the following questions: Has spatial inequality increased across Mexican municipios since 2000? What has been the role of place mobility in any changes in overall spatial inequality? Finally, we examine what the main components of place mobility have been over this period. We find evidence of a strong spatial dependency between municipios that has increased over time but we find no clear pattern at the state scale. Intra-state municipal inequality has relatively declined while Inter-state municipal inequality polarization has increased. We also find clear evidence that transitional dynamics of municipio incomes are influenced by spatial context. Substantial evidence shows that municipio income mobility is driven by a growth component that could be likely reflecting the devaluation of the peso over this period. Exchange mobility is found to be a more important component of overall place mobility than dispersion (inequality) mobility.},

  abstract = {Objective In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between socio-environmental characteristics of neighborhood of residence and the frequency of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among older adults from Porto (Portugal). Method Data from EpiPorto -- a prospective adult cohort study from Porto (Portugal) -- were used. Only adults aged {$\geq$}65 at baseline (1999--2003) were included (n=580). We used a Geographic Information System to objectively measure the neighborhood characteristics and Generalized Additive Models to estimate their effect on participation in LTPA (none vs. some reported) and frequency of LTPA (min/day). Results 62\% of the participants reported no LTPA. Active elderly spent on average 38 (women) and 67 (men) minutes per day exercising. Neighborhood characteristics were unrelated to whether older people exercised or not. However, among active individuals, distance to the nearest destination ({$\beta$}=-0.154, p=0.016), in women, and distance to the nearest park, in men (-0.030, 0.050), were predictors of LTPA frequency. Conclusion There was almost no association between neighborhood characteristics and whether older adults engaged in LTPA or not, but among those that did engage, neighborhood characteristics were associated with increased frequency of LTPA. The promotion of well distributed destinations and parks might improve physical activity levels among the elderly.},

Methods: Using a cross-sectional, population-based sample of Denver residents participating in the 2007 Neighborhood Environments and Health Survey (NEHS), we applied spatial regression models to examine the relationship between perceived aesthetic ratings and individual and neighborhood measures of the social and physical environment. Results: Perceived and observed incivilities, perceived walkability, area-level poverty, foreclosures, and greenness were significantly associated with neighborhood aesthetic ratings. In the presence of race/education interaction effect, college educated Hispanics had significantly different aesthetic ratings when compared to nonHispanic Black/Other and non-Hispanic Whites. Conclusion: Interventions which promote active and healthy lifestyles should consider both structural and perceived measures of the built environment, and recognize that interventions should be customized to reflect community-level differences in perceptions and experiences of place.},

Areas suitable for walking (walkability) are also associated with increased physical activity, but interactions with greenspace are poorly understood. We investigated associations of walkability and green walkability with physical activity in an urban adult cohort. We used cross-sectional data from Greater London UK Biobank participants (n = 57,726) and assessed walkability along roads and footpaths within 1000 m of their residential addresses. Additionally, we assessed green walkability by integrating trees and low-lying vegetation into the walkability index. Physical activity outcomes included self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical activity and active transport. We assessed associations using log-linear, logistic and linear regression models, adjusted for individual- and area-level confounders. Higher green walkability was associated with favourable International Physical Activity Questionnaire responses and achievement of weekly UK government physical activity guideline recommendations. Participants living in the highest versus lowest quintile of green walkability participated in 2.41 min (95\% confidence intervals: 0.22, 4.60) additional minutes of moderate-and-vigorous physical activity per day. Higher walkability and green walkability scores were also associated with choosing active transport modes such as walking and cycling. Our green walkability approach demonstrates the utility in accounting for walkability and greenspace simultaneously to understand the role of the built environment on physical activity.},

In-person audit of neighborhood environments is costly and time-consuming. Google Street View may allow auditing of neighborhood environments more easily and at lower cost, but little is known about the feasibility of such data collection. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of using Google Street View to audit neighborhood environments. Methods: This study compared neighborhood measurements coded in 2008 using Street View with neighborhood audit data collected in 2007. The sample included 37 block faces in high-walkability neighborhoods in New York City. Field audit and Street View data were collected for 143 items associated with seven neighborhood environment constructions: aesthetics, physical disorder, pedestrian safety, motorized traff{\i}c and parking, infrastructure for active travel, sidewalk amenities, and social and commercial activity. To measure concordance between f{\i}eld audit and Street View data, percentage agreement was used for categoric measures and Spearman rank-order correlations were used for continuous measures. Results: The analyses, conducted in 2009, found high levels of concordance ( 80\% agreement or 0.60 Spearman rank-order correlation) for 54.3\% of the items. Measures of pedestrian safety, motorized traff{\i}c and parking, and infrastructure for active travel had relatively high levels of concordance, whereas measures of physical disorder had low levels. Features that are small or that typically exhibit temporal variability had lower levels of concordance. Conclusions: This exploratory study indicates that Google Street View can be used to audit neighborhood environments.

Method Included in this review were 13 reviews published between 2002 and 2006 and 29 original studies published in 2005 and up through May 2006. Results were summarized based on specific characteristics of the built environment and transportation walking versus recreational walking. Results Previous reviews and newer studies document consistent positive relations between walking for transportation and density, distance to non-residential destinations, and land use mix; findings for route/network connectivity, parks and open space, and personal safety are more equivocal. Results regarding recreational walking were less clear. Conclusions More recent evidence supports the conclusions of prior reviews, and new studies address some of the limitations of earlier studies.

Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.},

Among all things and stuff in a scene, the road guides vehicles in the cities and highways. Most segmentation models, i.e., semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, have focused on images with clear daytime weather conditions. Few papers have tackled nighttime vision under adversarial conditions, i.e., fog, rain, snow, strong illumination, and disaster events. Moreover, further segmentation of road conditions like dry, wet, and snow is still challenging under such invisible conditions. Weather impacts not only visibility but also roads and their surrounding environment, causing vital disasters with obstacles on the road, i.e., rocks and water. This paper proposes PanopticRoad with five Deep Learningbased modules for road condition segmentation under adversarial conditions: DeepReject/Scene/Snow/Depth/Road. Integration of them helps refine the failure of local road conditions where weather and physical constraints are applied. Using foggy and heavy snowfall nighttime road images and disaster images, the superiority of PanopticRoad is demonstrated over state-of-the-art panoptic-based and adaptive domain-based Deep Learning models in terms of stability, robustness, and accuracy.},

In locu observations to assess the walkability of the surrounding environment and to map the services and amenities at a 400 m and 800 m radius were also conducted. It was found that many older adults leave the facilities on foot and that their main motivation to do so was to access a specific service.

  abstract = {In recent years, a series of studies have highlighted the positive effects of urban green on individual activity behaviour and health. In this paper, we examine salutogenic environment effects of urban green upon walking behaviour and how such effects are mediated by built environment configuration and street-level physical accessibility. The dwelling locations of N=15,354 respondents of the London Travel Demand Survey were geocoded and individual walking behaviour was extracted from the travel diary. A 0.5-m resolution normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) index derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data was employed as an objective measure of greenness, while density of street trees acted as proxy of perceived environmental quality in street corridors. A network model of street-level physical accessibility was developed using spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA). Logistic regression models reported a significant association of odds of walking with density of street trees and street-level betweenness (a measure of street network connectivity), while sensitivity analyses with continuous regression models for participants doing some walking indicated beneficial associations of distance walked with NDVI greenness and street trees. The results illustrate the necessity for targeted intervention strategies in activity-friendly planning via greening and optimized physical design of urban built environments.},

  abstract = {In this article, we describe the design of a method for measuring walkability and its application in two medium-sized cities in Germany. The method modifies the established Walk Score with regard to the needs of older people. While the original Walk Score takes a 2D approach by calculating the reachability of service facilities on a flat road network, we include 3D information by taking into account slopes and stairs. We also pay attention to the longer walking times of the elderly and adjust the selection and weighting of supply facilities according to their relevance for elderly people. The implementation results in a concentric walkability pattern, with a high Walk Score in the inner-city area that is decreasing towards the periphery, but with many anomalies resulting from local inhomogeneity in population and facility distribution and topography. The study shows that it is possible to refine the Walk Score to meet the needs of older people, as well as to implement the methodology in Germany using a combination of voluntary geographic information and high-quality official datasets. We see our research as a step forward on the way to more realistic walkability metrics for senior-sensitive urban planning.},

Three types of large-scale PTNs are generated, and the overall network structure of PTNs are examined and found to follow heavy-tailed distributions (mostly power law). Further, three traditional centrality measures (i.e. degree, betweenness and closeness) are adopted and modified to dynamically explore the relationship between PTNs and passenger flow. Our findings show that, the modified centrality measures outperform the traditional centrality measures in estimating passenger flow.},

Taking Moscow as a case study we focused on assessing the walkability through a well-known walkability index using only open data sources. The application of the walkability index to Moscow required some adjustments in its calculation, however, the methodology used has brought the results that could be expected. The strong spatial heterogeneity in walkability was clearly identified within the city. Moreover, the walkability and social differentiation within the city boundaries could have the same spatial patterns. Despite the significant changes and evolution of urban environment throughout the Moscow's history, especially in recent years, historical context is still as impactful as before in terms of walkability. Green infrastructure might be an important component of the walkability index in the context of a healthy urban environment and well-being. Although Moscow could be identified as a green city, some areas cannot adequately provide green infrastructure for all of their residents, primarily due to the remoteness of large parks. According to the results of our study, the priority should be directed towards the improvement of consistency of the green infrastructure network and diversification of land-use in the most vulnerable areas of post-industrial development.},

  abstract = {In the spirit of strengthening its intellectual foundations and clarifying its contributions to making sense of Earth, we should resist any inclination to treat geography as a club---a discipline with boundaries to be policed and defended. I advocate for the strengths of thinking geographically, a way of being in the world open to all. This means attending to the geography of knowledge production; how spatiotemporalities shape and are shaped by socionatural processes; the emergent more-than-human world; the variety of ontologies, epistemologies, and methodologies underlying knowledge claims; and the world not only as it is but also as it should be. Thinking geographically about globalizing capitalism can problematize the particular sociospatial positionalities from which commonsense understandings of capitalism have metastasized. Europe did not invent capitalist practices but became globalizing capitalism's center of calculation, catalyzed by the spatial dynamics of colonialism elevating Europe relative to its predecessors. Thinking geographically undermines the mainstream account of globalizing capitalism emanating from Europe, that of a rising tide capable of lifting all boats and bringing prosperity to all hard-working and responsible individuals and well-governed territories. Indeed, such body- and place-based accounts obscure how asymmetric connectivities between places and interscalar dynamics, coevolving with uneven geographical development, coproduce unequal sociospatial positionality and conditions of possibility for those propagating and encountering globalizing capitalism. Capitalism also cannot be understood, or practiced, simply as an economic process; its economic aspects are co-implicated with political, cultural (gendered, raced, etc.), social, and biophysical processes, in ways that repeatedly exceed and undermine any ``laws of economics.'' Thinking geographically necessitates acknowledging space for alternative, more-than-capitalist experiments and trajectories, enriched by peripheral experiences of and encounters with globalizing capitalism.},

A framework is proposed that includes three methods. First, a rule-based approach is proposed to identify the home location of the elderly cardholders based on individual travel pattern. The result has strong correlation with the real elderly population. Second, the clustering method is adopted to group bus stops based on the elderly travel flow. The center points of clusters are utilized to construct a Voronoi diagram. Third, a quasi-gravity model is proposed to reveal the elderly mobility between regions, using the public facilities index. The model measures the elderly travel number between regions, according to public facilities index on the basis of the total number of point of interest (POI) data. Beijing is used as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods, and the methods can be widely used for urban planning, design and management regarding the aging population.},

However, prior studies have overlooked the impact of the micro-level street environment, which might lead to biased prediction. To fill this gap, we developed an effective machine learning (ML) framework to predict neighborhood-level residential CEs based on a single data source, street view images (SVIs), which are publicly available worldwide. Specifically, more than 30 streetscape elements were classified from SVIs using semantic segmentation to describe the micro-level street environment, whose visual features can indicate major socioeconomic activities that significantly affect residential CEs. A ten-fold cross-validation was deployed to train ML models to predict the residential CEs at the 1 km grid level. We found, first, that random forest (R2 = 0.8) outperforms many traditional models, confirming that visual features are non-negligible in explaining CEs. Second, more building, wall, and fence views indicate higher CEs. Third, the presence of trees and grass is inversely related to CEs. Our findings justify the feasibility of using SVIs as a single data source to effectively predict neighborhood-level residential CEs. The framework is applicable to large regions across diverse urban forms, informing urban planners of sustainable urban form strategies to achieve carbon-neutral goals, especially for the development of new towns.},

Additionally, previous studies identified walkable environments on a neighborhood-scale, not at a meso- and micro-scale. This study fills these gaps by examining the effects of multifaceted walkable environments on commercial property values in Seoul, Korea. Based on sales transaction data between 2017 and 2019, we employed the hedonic price model to clarify the relationships between walkable environments and commercial property values. This study estimated walkable environments using semantic segmentation based on Google Street View images. Furthermore, we accounted for commercial submarkets to identify how the impacts of walkability vary across areas stratified by living population density. The results show that various walkable environments positively affect nearby commercial property values. Additionally, these effects vary across commercial submarkets' heterogeneity. Our findings provide a variety of suggestions for encouraging the creation of walkable environments and increasing the economic benefits of commercial properties.},

  abstract = {Background: Health economic evaluation has a crucial role to play in the allocation of scarce societal resources. Economic models used in these evaluations must have a high degree of external validity but must also be usable in order to effectively inform policy. However, there is sometimes a trade-off between the realism of models (external validity) and the ease with which stakeholders can understand and interact with them (usability). This trade-off is particularly relevant in the field of physical activity where modelling is complicated and data availability is limited. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the balance between the external-validity and usability of models used in health economic evaluations of physical activity interventions and develop ways to build models that are more externally valid and usable.},

  abstract = {This article reviews research on the effects of economic recessions on fertility in the developed world. We study how economic downturns, as measured by various indicators, especially by declining GDP levels, falling consumer confdence, and rising unemployment, were found to affect fertility. We also discuss particular mechanisms through which the recession may have influenced fertility behavior, including the effects of economic uncertainty, falling income, changes in the housing market, and rising enrollment in higher education, and also factors that influence fertility indirectly such as declining marriage rates. Most studies find that fertility tends to be pro-cyclical and often rises and declines with the ups and downs of the business cycle. Usually, these aggregate effects are relatively small (typically, a few percentage points) and of short durations; in addition they often influence especially the timing of childbearing and in most cases do not leave an imprint on cohort fertility levels. Therefore, major long-term fertility shifts often continue seemingly uninterrupted during the recession---including the fertility declines before and during the Great Depression of the 1930s and before and during the oil shock crises of the 1970s. Changes in the opportunity costs of childbearing and fertility behavior during economic downturn vary by sex, age, social status, and number of children; childless young adults are usually most affected. Furthermore, various policies and institutions may modify or even reverse the relationship between recessions and fertility. The first evidence pertaining to the recent recession falls in line with these findings. In most countries, the recession has brought a decline in the number of births and fertility rates, often marking a sharp halt to the previous decade of rising fertility rates.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) signals collected by satellites in the solar spectrum are modified by scattering and absorption by gases and aerosols while traveling through the atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the sensor. When and how to correct the atmospheric effects depend on the remote sensing and atmospheric data available, the information desired, and the analytical methods used to extract the information. In many applications involving classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary as long as the training data and the data to be classified are in the same relative scale. In other circumstances, corrections are mandatory to put multitemporal data on the same radiometric scale in order to monitor terrestrial surfaces over time. A multitemporal dataset consisting of seven Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988 to 1996 of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China was used to compare seven absolute and one relative atmospheric correction algorithms with uncorrected raw data. Based on classification and change detection results, all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries--Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lead to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification and change detection applications.},

However, research on built environmental correlates of obesity in this age group is limited. The current study aimed to explore associations of Walk Score, a validated measure of neighborhood walkability, with BMI and waist circumference in a large, diverse sample of older women. Methods: This study linked cross-sectional data on 6,526 older postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative Long Life Study (2012--2013) to Walk Scores for each participant's address (collected in 2012). Linear and logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of BMI and waist circumference with continuous and categorical Walk Score measures. Secondary analyses examined whether these relationships could be explained by walking expenditure or total physical activity. All analyses were conducted in 2015. Results: Higher Walk Score was not associated with BMI or overall obesity after adjustment for sociodemographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. However, participants in highly walkable areas had significantly lower odds of abdominal obesity (waist circumference 488 cm) as compared with those in less walkable locations. Observed associations between walkability and adiposity were partly explained by walking expenditure. Conclusions: Findings suggest that neighborhood walkability is linked to abdominal adiposity, as measured by waist circumference, among older women and provide support for future longitudinal research on associations between Walk Score and adiposity in this population.},

Second, our study reveals that the popular press discusses low fertility as a serious concern with mostly negative implications, despite the fact that many of the causes of low fertility are associated with social and economic progress. Third, the variety of issues and perspectives revealed in the public debate, while cohesive in general ways, invites a role for demographers in informing an accurate public discussion of low fertility, which will help form the most appropriate policy outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Physical activity is essential for health; walking is the easiest way to incorporate activity into everyday life. Previous studies report positive associations between neighbourhood walkability and walking but most focused on cities in North America and Australasia. Urban form with respect to street connectivity, residential density and land use mix---common components of walkability indices---differs in European cities. The objective of this study was to develop a walkability index for London and test the index using walking data from the Whitehall II Study. Methods: A neighbourhood walkability index for London was constructed, comprising factors associated with walking behaviours: residential dwelling density, street connectivity and land use mix. Three models were produced that differed in the land uses included. Neighbourhoods were operationalised at three levels of administrative geography: (i) 21,140 output areas, (ii) 633 wards and (iii) 33 local authorities. A neighbourhood walkability score was assigned to each London-dwelling Whitehall II Study participant (2003--04, N = 3020, mean {\textpm} SD age = 61.0 years {\textpm} 6.0) based on residential postcode. The effect of changing the model specification and the units of enumeration on spatial variation in walkability was examined. Results: There was a radial decay in walkability from the centre to the periphery of London. There was high inter-model correlation in walkability scores for any given neighbourhood operationalisation (0.92--0.98), and moderate-high correlation between neighbourhood operationalisations for any given model (0.39--0.70). After adjustment for individual level factors and area deprivation, individuals in the most walkable neighbourhoods operationalised as wards were more likely to walk {$>$}6 h/week (OR = 1.4; 95 \% CI: 1.1--1.9) than those in the least walkable. Conclusions: Walkability was associated with walking time in adults. This walkability index could help urban planners identify and design neighbourhoods in London with characteristics more supportive of walking, thereby promoting public health.},

  abstract = {Much of Singapore's recent problems with social acceptance and integration of foreigners is attributed to the city-state's sustained ultra-low fertility. To augment labour shortage, state policies on immigrant were eased to facilitate an inflow of guest workers. The backlash on rapid globalisation of the workforce was felt acutely when the nonresident segment rose to account for over 20\% of the almost 5.2 million population. To ease social tension between locals and foreigners, the city-state has to curb reliance on foreign labour through ensuring a steady growth of the local population. This paper discusses the social, cultural and structural barriers to fertility growth. The discourse highlights limitations of poor work-life integration as well as over-demands on parenting. Radical transformations that target macro structures are proposed to return to centre the social institution of the family. The proposals hope to affect a better work-life balance and reconceptualise responsible parenting so that singles have sufficient resources to invest in marriage, and family formation becomes a more achievable life goal for Singaporeans.},

  abstract = {International land use planners tend to focus on walkability that could shape both residential behaviors and health outcomes. Understanding the relationships among community deprivation, walkability, and health outcomes will provide insights into appropriate land use planning that supports public health promotion. This paper develops a revised Walk Score tool for measuring community walkability in China. Under the original Walk Score methodological framework, (1) 6 principle amenities (19 items) and their weight (utilization frequency) are first selected by expert panel evaluation and questionnaire survey; (2) a tolerance time approach is then employed to determine the decay function, and the walking travel time from community to each amenity is calculated by using the Baidu Map; and (3) three pedestrian characteristic factors (intersection density, block length, and slope) are considered to adjust the score. We apply the proposed methodology to the case of Shenzhen and discover great variations in walkability among the 8117 communities within it. The high--high clusters are located in the central blocks, while the low--low clusters emerge in the outskirts. Using spatial regression, we observe significant negative associations between community walkability and three health indicators (cardiopathy, hypertension, and liver cancer). It suggests that better health outcomes would be observed in more walkable communities. We further find that children concentrated and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities exhibit lower walkability. These results evidence the significant social inequalities in walkability among the communities of Shenzhen. Path analysis identifies complex linkages among community deprivation, walkability, and public health. For cadiopathy and hypertension, three categories of significant paths are identified: (1) residents in deprived community have worse health outcomes due to lower walkability; (2) poorer health outcomes occur in deprived communities as a result of higher PM2.5 exposure; and (3) less walkable communities are exposed to greater PM2.5 concentration and deprived communities are generally characterized by lower walkability and consequently have worse health outcomes. We argue that social inequalities in walkability should attract the attention of land use planners. In order to address this pressing issue, three areas should be given priorities in future land use planning: (1) adopting urban form-based zoning schemes; (2) economic inputs for streetscape improvements; and (3) formulating affordable and low-renting housing policies. Findings of this case should generate more generalized knowledge that enhances public health promotion within the land use planning context.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9\% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3~m~{\texttimes}~3~m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street-level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11\%. We also show examples of prediction maps from both approaches to visually highlight performance differences.},

Understanding the dynamics associated with wildfire, such as risks, spatial distribution, and effects is important for developing a clear understanding of its ecological influences. Remote sensing technologies provide a means to study fire ecology at multiple scales using an efficient and quantitative method. This paper provides a broad review of the applications of remote sensing techniques in fire ecology. Remote sensing applications related to fire risk mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, burned area estimates, burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery monitoring are discussed. Emphasis is given to the roles of multispectral sensors, lidar, and emerging UAS technologies in mapping, analyzing, and monitoring various environmental properties related to fire activity. Examples of current and past research are provided, and future research trends are discussed. In general, remote sensing technologies provide a low-cost, multi-temporal means for conducting local, regional, and global-scale fire ecology research, and current research is rapidly evolving with the introduction of new technologies and techniques which are increasing accuracy and efficiency. Future research is anticipated to continue to build upon emerging technologies, improve current methods, and integrate novel approaches to analysis and classification.},

A line of efforts has proven that global context matters in urban scene segmentation due to massive scale changes. However, we find that existing methods suffer from local ambiguities when dissipating continuous local context, i.e. scrambling to a huge receptive field of global cues by coarse pooling. To this end, this paper proposes a new Context Aggregation Module (CAM) that consists of two primary components: context encoding using no coarse pooling but encoder-decoders with appropriate sampling scales and gated fusion that extends gate attention mechanism to balance different-scale context during feature fusion. Weeding out coarse pooling and applying the encoder-decoder inherits the merits of exploring global context while avoiding the drawback of losing local contextual continuity. We then construct a Context Aggregation Network (CANet) and conduct extensive evaluations on challenging autonomous driving benchmarks of Cityscapes, CamVid and BDD100K. Consistently improved results evidence the effectiveness. Notably, we attain competitive mIoU 82.7\% on Cityscapes and optimal mIoU 80.5\% on CamVid.},

  abstract = {Cities occupy only about 3\% of the Earth's surface area, but half of the global population lives in them. The high population density in urban areas requires special actions to make these areas develop sustainably. One of the greatest challenges of the modern world is to organize urban spaces in a way to make them attractive, safe and friendly to people living in cities. This can be managed with the help of a number of indicators, one of which is walkability. Of course, the most complete analyses are based on spatial data, and the easiest way to implement them is using GIS tools. Therefore, the goal of the paper is to present a new approach for measuring walkability, which is based on density maps of specific urban functions and networks of generally accessible pavements and paths. The method is implemented using open-source data. Density values are interpolated from point data (urban objects featuring specific functions) and polygons (pedestrian infrastructure) using Kernel Density and Line Density tools in GIS. The obtained values allow the calculation of a synthetic indicator taking into account the access by means of pedestrian infrastructure to public transport stops, parks and recreation areas, various attractions, shops and services. The proposed method was applied to calculate the walkability for Krak{\'o}w (the second largest city in Poland). The greatest value of walkability was obtained for the Main Square (central part of the Old Town). The least accessible to pedestrians are, on the other hand, areas located on the outskirts of the city, which are intended for extensive industrial areas, single-family housing or large green areas.},

  abstract = {Solar radiation reflected by the Earth's surface to satellite sensors is modified by its interaction with the atmosphere. The objective of atmospheric correction is to determine true surface reflectance values by removing atmospheric effects from satellite images. Atmospheric correction is arguably the most important part of the pre-processing of satellite remotely sensed data and any omission produces erroneous results. The effects of the atmosphere are more severe for where dark targets are shown in the satellite image. In the management of cultural heritage sites, since temporal satellite images are required for monitoring purposes, the effect of the atmosphere must be considered. Classification techniques are also required to map land-cover changes in the vicinity of important cultural-heritage sites. Detection of important cultural heritage sites needs effective post-processing techniques. Indeed, any unsuccessful attempt to remove the atmospheric effects from the satellite remotely sensed images may cause non-reliable reflectance values. The paper presents a method of assessing the need for atmospheric correction, and addresses the importance of removing atmospheric effects in the satellite remote sensing of land-surfaces including cultural heritage.},

For better management of the existing crops and to bring more area under horticulture crops, updated and accurate database is necessary for systematic planning and decision making. Remote sensing (RS) is an advanced tool that aids in gathering and updating information to develop scientific management plans. Many types of sensors namely microwave radiometers, laser meters, magnetic sensors and cameras collect electromagnetic information to derive accurate, large-scale information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Because these data and images are digital, they can easily be quantified and manipulated using computers. RS can be used in efforts to reduce the risk and minimize damage. The same data can be analyzed in different ways for different applications. A number of studies were aiming at identification of crop, area estimation, disease and pest identification, etc. using satellite data in horticulture. The potential use of RS techniques in Horticulture is briefly reviewed in order to exploit the available techniques for efficient crop management.},

Recently, the 15-minute city concept emphasized this framework by stressing proximity as a key urban feature. In this paper, we use two accessibility indicators---cumulative opportunities (total destinations) and Variety (number of different types of opportunities)---to evaluate pedestrian accessibility, using a 15-minute threshold, in a sample of European cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants, and measure within-city and between-city inequality, by calculating pseudo-Gini coefficients. Our results show not only that European cities are not 15-minute cities yet, but also that there is significant inequality within them, although less so in cities with high Variety. Our cross-city comparison found diminishing returns between both total destinations and population density and between Variety and density. Our findings suggest that European cities can increase pedestrian accessibility and reduce internal inequality by increasing the Variety of opportunities accessible by foot, along with improvements to pedestrian infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Background Physical activity is recommended to promote healthy aging. Defining the importance of activities such as walking in achieving higher levels of physical activity might provide indications for interventions. Objective To describe the importance of walking in achieving higher levels of physical activity in older adults. Methods The study included 42 healthy subjects aged between 51 and 84 years (mean body mass index 25.6 kg/m2 [SD 2.6]). Physical activity, walking, and nonwalking activity were monitored with an accelerometer for 2 weeks. Physical activity was quantified by accelerometer-derived activity counts. An algorithm based on template matching and signal power was developed to classify activity counts into nonwalking counts, short walk counts, and long walk counts. Additionally, in a subgroup of 31 subjects energy expenditure was measured using doubly labeled water to derive physical activity level (PAL). Results Subjects had a mean PAL of 1.84 (SD 0.19, range 1.43-2.36). About 20\% of the activity time (21\% [SD 8]) was spent walking, which accounted for about 40\% of the total counts (43\% [SD 11]). Short bouts composed 83\% (SD 9) of walking time, providing 81\% (SD 11) of walking counts. A stepwise regression model to predict PAL included nonwalking counts and short walk counts, explaining 58\% of the variance of PAL (standard error of the estimate=0.12). Walking activities produced more counts per minute than nonwalking activities (P{$<$}.001). Long walks produced more counts per minute than short walks (P=.001). Nonwalking counts were independent of walking counts (r=-.05, P=.38). Conclusions Walking activities are a major contributor to physical activity in older adults. Walking activities occur at higher intensities than nonwalking activities, which might prevent individuals from engaging in more walking activity. Finally, subjects who engage in more walking activities do not tend to compensate by limiting nonwalking activities.

However, in the light of increasing mixed-methods research, as well as research using geocodes, it is necessary to train students in the field of ethics. Experiential learning is an approach to teaching that is potentially suitable for teaching ethics. The aim of this article is to discuss how the experiential learning process in a course on Ethics \& GPS-tracking contributed to the ethical awareness of third-year undergraduate geography students. We conducted a qualitative study in which we held four focus group discussions with two cohorts of students (2016 and 2017). We explored the students' views on the learning environment in relation to ethics in GPS-based and mixed-methods research. Our findings show how an informal learning environment and collaborative learning in a small group contributed to deep understanding of research ethics. These aspects of the learning environment are tied to an ethical framework that consists of three dimensions: (1) the ethics of collaborative research between staff and students; (2) the ethics of privacy raised by the geo-technology adopted in this research case study; and (3) the ethics of the research process with respect to informed consent and data storage.},

This article focuses specifically on feelings of loneliness as an important aspect of quality of life in relation with mobility aspects and built environmental characteristics. Based on data collected in the southeast of the Netherlands among 344 respondents in 2014 four ordered logit models were estimated to explain the extent to which people feel lonely or socially isolated. The explanatory variables in the models are age; other personal and household characteristics; characteristics of the built environment and mobility aspects. The results indicate that, although age has little explanatory power, older people are likely to feel lonelier. Other personal and household characteristics, such as household composition, education, health status, being a volunteer and the number of social interactions are found to have more explanatory power. Characteristics of the built environment also explain a substantial part of variance in loneliness. Significant effects are found for living in an apartment, length of residence in the neighbourhood and satisfaction with the neighbourhood and its facilities. Finally, we find that the use of different transport modes (bicycle, car and public transport) significantly reduces loneliness.},

  abstract = {Spatial justice, specifically accessibility, Universal Design and the fulfilment of human rights for vulnerable groups are increasingly deemed relevant issues in urban research and citylevel agendas concerning public spaces. Although the development of older adult--friendly urban environments is part of the agenda to promote healthy ageing societies, public spaces (e.g., urban parks) often exclude those in the advanced age group in the community. This article offers a preliminary assessment of the older adult--friendly urban environments, hostile urban design elements and the everyday activities of older adults in urban parks by focusing on the extreme case of Sham Shui Po. This is a low-income, high-density and public space--scarce neighbourhood in Hong Kong, a city characterised by a rapidly ageing population and high socio-spatial inequality. Qualitative methods as environment audit, direct observations and video-recordings were used to investigate the physical environment and the older adults' social and physical activities. Two representative urban parks are selected, the Nam Cheong Street Sitting-out Area (NCSA) and Tai Hang Tung Park (THTP). NCSA, located in a congested vehicular street median, allows independent mobility and is predominantly for intergenerational social activities. It is part of the daily route of residents and inhabitants from different ethnicities. Hostile design prevents the full use of seating facilities. THTP is a site for older adults to engage in physical activities and also accommodates large groups and caregivers. Defensive architecture and design layout may affect the group size in the parks, while sittable edges may directly contribute to the park use by older adults with physical disabilities, particularly near street crossings. The findings from this deprived neighbourhood highlight the critical role of landscape infrastructure for healthy ageing societies.},

  abstract = {Design of the built environment for navigability and walkability is an increasingly important aspect of urban planning. This focus derives in part from increasing interest in lifestyles and behaviours, including level of physical activity and health outcomes. Geographical information systems and virtual realities are playing a significant role in advancing this agenda: examples exist of integrating qualitative data (words about or visual images of places) and quantitative data (numerical descriptions of places). However, there remain opportunities for exploring alternative ways of linking different types of data (physiological measurements, emotional response, street walkability and urban design quality) to address issues of urban planning and renewal. Using a case study approach this paper explores the application of geographic information science and systems to participatory approaches in built environment planning with the aim of exploring older people's response to an unfamiliar urban environment. It examines different ways of combining temporally and spatial referenced qualitative and quantitative data. The participants in the study were a group of 44 older people (60+) from Swansea, Wales, who viewed a filmed walking route around Colchester, England. While viewing the film they gave an oral commentary and physiological readings were made, which have been integrated with primary data collected on the built environment along the walking route. Proximity and inverse distance weighting approaches for combining these datasets produce complementary results in respect of older people's physiological and emotive response to variation in the walkability and design quality of a walking route through an unfamiliar town centre. The results reveal participants experienced an elevated average heart rate close to Colchester Town railway station and expressed a comparatively negative emotional response to this location. Conversely participants experienced lower average heart rate, indicating reduced stress, in Brook Street where the overall Urban Design Quality score was relatively low.},

Previous GIS-based approaches to urban planning for this issue tend to be subjective with high labour costs. This paper uses the generative adversarial network (GAN) to explore the relationship between amenities distributions and urban morphology, thus effectively predicting and visualizing the ideal amenities distributions in fastgrowing cities based on the condition of well-developed megacities. In this research, we take Shanghai, one of the global cities in China with a big labour market, as the research sample. First, we use the Point of Interest (POI) data to draw the heatmap of urban amenities that support workers' daily life and collect the corresponding city maps. Then, we cut them into hundreds of image pairs as the training set and train a GAN model for predicting the future amenities distributions in other cities. To implement the model, we further collect the city maps of Jiaxing, one of the second-tier cities near Shanghai, as the testing set. Results show that our trained model can accurately predict amenities distributions for its future. The GAN-based prediction could effectively support detailed urban planning.},

Spatial access emphasizes the importance of geographic barrier between consumer and provider, and nonspatial factors include nongeographic barriers or facilitators such as age, sex, ethnicity, income, social class, education and language ability. The population and socioeconomic data are from the 2000 Census, and the primary care physician data for the same year are provided by the American Medical Association. First, a two-step floating catchment area method implemented in Geographic Information Systems is used to measure spatial accessibility based on travel time. Secondly, the factor analysis method is used to group various sociodemographic variables into three factors: (1) socioeconomic disadvantages, (2) sociocultural barriers and (3) high healthcare needs. Finally, spatial and nonspatial factors are integrated to identify areas with poor access to primary healthcare. The research is intended to develop an integrated approach for defining Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) that may help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve HPSA designation.},

This paper examines possible associations between several risk factors and late-stage diagnosis for four types of cancer in Illinois: breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Potential risk factors are composed of spatial factors and nonspatial factors. The spatial factors include accessibility to primary healthcare and distance or travel time to the nearest cancer screening facility. A set of demographic and socioeconomic variables are consolidated into three nonspatial factors by factor analysis. The Bayesian model with convolution priors is utilised to analyse the relationship between the above risk factors and each type of late-stage cancer while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. The results for breast cancer suggest that people living in neighbourhoods with socioeconomic disadvantages and cultural barriers are more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage. In regard to prostate cancer, people in regions with low socioeconomic status are also more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage. Diagnosis of late-stage colorectal or lung cancer is not significantly associated with any of the abovementioned risk factors. The results have important implications in public policy.},

Visual walkability is an example of such an index, where different results may be obtained depending on locational and temporal factors. This paper introduces a new index called Type of Visual Walkability (TVW) to characterize and classify street-level visual walkability in Inner London utilizing Mapillary images. The method is based on panoptic segmentation, where pixel-level segmentation and instance count are used in combination to generate more robust indicators of greenery, openness, crowdedness, and visual pavement. Following this, the TVW at street segment level is calculated and the spatiotemporal dynamics of TVW are explored. The results show significant seasonal variations. Specifically, many greenery-dominated streets become openness-dominated from autumn to winter and pavement-dominated streets become crowdedness-dominated in summer and autumn due to vegetation phenology and human activities. This case study showed that TVW provides a dynamic and explainable perspective in understanding urban design qualities for walkability. It facilitates the connection between assessment of the built environment and spatiotemporal analysis derived from street-level images and will inform urban planners and governments in building a walkable city and further promote active transport.},

Federal programs such as the designations of Medically Underserved Areas/Populations and Health Professional Shortage Areas are designed to boost the number of health professionals serving these areas and to help alleviate the access problem. Their effectiveness relies first and foremost on an accurate measure of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. Various measures of accessibility need to be integrated into one framework for comparison and evaluation. Optimization methods can be used to improve the distribution and supply of health care providers to maximize service coverage, minimize travel needs of patients, limit the number of facilities, and maximize health or access equality. Inequality in health care access comes at a personal and societal price, evidenced in disparities in health outcomes, including late-stage cancer diagnosis. This review surveys recent literature on the three named issues with emphasis on methodological advancements and implications for public policy.},

The literature review covers 136 papers that were published between 2008 and 2018 and retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Firstly, a bibliometric analysis is conducted to give a general view of recent studies. Secondly, a detailed critical review is performed from three major perspectives concerning neighbourhood walkability, namely, walkability measurements, the built environment and health, and the applications of walkability. Finally, research trends and future directions are discussed. The implications include: (a) factors affecting walkability and their interactions should be investigated; (b) more accurate data need to be available for the measurement of walkability; (c) relevant research in the contexts of different countries could be expanded and compared; (d) the application of walkability could be developed in terms of depth and width.},

However, most empirical studies have typically focused on objective built environmental measures. Still, perceptions of the built environment also play an important role in health and may complement studies with objective measures. Some built environment attributes, such as liveliness or beauty, are difficult to measure objectively. Traditional methods to assess perceptions of the built environment, such as questionnaires and focus groups, are time-consuming and prone to recall bias. The recent development in machine deep learning techniques and big data of street view images, makes it possible to assess perceptions of the built environment with street view images for a large-scale study area. By using online free Tencent Street View (TSV) images, this study assessed six perceptual attributes of the built environment: wealth, safety, liveliness, depression, bore and beauty. These attributes were associated with both the physical and the mental health outcomes of 1231 older adults in 48 neighborhoods in the Haidian District, Beijing, China. Results show that perceived safety was significantly associated with both the physical and mental health outcomes. Perceived depression and beauty were significant related to older adults' mental health, while perceived wealth, bore and liveliness were significantly related to their physical health. The findings carry important policy implications and hence contribute to the development of healthy cities. It is urgent to improve residents' positive perceptions and decrease their negative perceptions of the built environment, especially in neighborhoods that are highly populated by older adults.},

Nevertheless, evidence of a beneficial association between walkability and older adults' mental health is still scarce in developing countries. Furthermore, walkability was often measured through Geographic Information System (GIS) methods. Recently, the methodological development in street view images, such as using Google or Tencent Street View, has offered an attractive alternative. Methods: Using Tencent street view images and machine learning classification methods, we quantify visual enclosure for neighbourhood street walkability with the proportion of visible sky in those images. Depression and anxiety data were extracted from mental health surveys for 1231 older adults in Beijing, China in 2011. Multilevel linear regression models were used to assess the associations. Results: Street walkability was negatively associated with Geriatric Depression Scale scores (GDS 15-item) and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory scores (GAI 20-item), and the results of different robustness checks also support this relationship. The associations were stronger for disadvantaged older adults than others. Conclusion: The present study indicates a potential beneficial role of street walkability on mental health (depression and anxiety) in older residents, especially for disadvantaged older adults. Additional longitudinal studies are required to address some limitations of this study, such as residential self-selection bias.},

This study is the first attempt to measure perception of neighborhood safety using street view data and a machine learning approach. Four potential mediating pathways linking perception of neighborhood safety to mental health were explored for 1029 participants from 35 neighborhoods of Guangzhou, China. The results of multilevel regression models confirm that perception of neighborhood safety is positively associated with mental health. More importantly, physical activity, social cohesion, stress and life satisfaction mediate this relationship. The results of a moderation analysis suggest that the beneficial effects of physical activity and social cohesion on mental health are strengthened by a perception of neighborhood safety. Our findings suggest the need to increase residents' perception of neighborhood safety to maintain mental health in urban areas of China.},

  abstract = {The rapidly aging population demands more public and academic attention to both the physical and psycho\- logical needs of older adults. Walking is one of the most favored forms of transportation and exercise for older adults. Hence, the conditions of walkways and the built environment are critical for the development of an older adults-friendly society. In this research, considering six indicators of greenness, walkability, safety, imageability, enclosure, and complexity, a novel quantitative evaluation model based on multi-source geospatial big datasets is proposed for assessing the age-friendliness of streets' walking environment from both the older adults' and ex\- perts' perspectives and has also been successfully applied in the case study of Xuhui District in Shanghai, China. Based on the survey with both groups of older adults and experts, the age-friendliness of the streets' walking environment from both perspectives was obtained, analyzed, and compared. The results show that among all subdistricts in Xuhui District, Tianping Road Sub-district and Hunan Road Sub-district have the best walking environment; and the roads surrounding expressways or arterial roads typically have lower levels of agefriendliness, while sub-arterial roads and access roads generally exhibit higher levels of age-friendliness ac\- cording to both older adults and experts. It is also noted that streets with high age-friendliness for older adults tend to be outstanding in walkability and greenness, whereas experts prefer streets with high safety and walk\- ability. In addition, the comprehensive analysis of the impact factors on age-friendliness further reveals a series of hidden significant influencing factors associated with the different preferences between older adults and ex\- perts. It is believed that our findings are useful for supporting policy-makers on how to improve the agefriendliness of streets and build age-friendly cities.},

More than two-thirds of this strong association acts through contraceptive prevalence. Further analyses confirm the relationship between intention and fertility across time for those countries for which there were two sources of data about five years apart (on average). The conclusion reached is that the proportion of women reporting that they want no more children has high predictive validity and is therefore a useful tool for short-term fertility forecasting.},

  abstract = {Walking is essential for the health and well-being of communities as well as meeting environmental challenges of the 21st Century. There have been significant research contributions in recent decades to understanding factors that can influence the likelihood of citizens choosing active travel modes, with great advances in understanding the built environment, particularly macro-scaled urban factors such as land-use mix, population density, and street patterns. So why are people still not walking? And is there anything we can do to try to change this? To answer these questions, this paper explores walking environment assessment approaches using a transdisciplinary narrative approach, touching on multiple critical disciplinary knowledge areas. We find that while much of the research into the built environment's influence on walking has made positive contributions in helping identify areas of cities that discourage active travel, the capacity to improve these areas has been limited. While macro-scaled factors commonly considered in `walkability' analysis are highly influential to mode choice, unless working on green-field development, these factors may require re-zoning private land, substantial demolition and renewal, and may be financially or politically infeasible and thus extremely difficult to change. There is a need to augment macro-scaled analysis with micro-scaled tools, and to establish multi-criterion spatio-temporal design decision support approaches drawing from emerging technologies to make informed, integrated and effective urban design changes. These methods applied at precinct and streetscape levels have the potential to make feasible improvements to the `walk-quality' of the built environment and contribute to facilitating active travel.},

  abstract = {Promoting environmentally and socially sustainable urban mobility is crucial for cities, with urban greening emerging as a key strategy. Contact with nature during travel not only enhances well-being but also promotes sustainable behaviour. However, the availability of travel greenery varies, and only recently have new datasets and computational approaches made it possible to compare the conditions in the distribution of travel greenery within and between cities quantitatively. In this study of 43 large European cities, we undertook a comparative analysis of travel greenery availability by using high-resolution spatial data and daily school trips as a marker of a daily travel need. By recognising walking accessibility as the most sustainable and equally available mode of transportation, we first estimated the proportion of the population residing within walking distance to upper secondary schools. Second, we associated the detailed school routes with monthly green cover data and compared the spatial variation in travel greenery availability between European cities, taking seasonal variation into account. Lastly, we analysed spatial inequalities of travel greenery availability within the study cities using the Gini index, the Kolm-Pollak equally-distributed equivalent (EDE) index and Moran's I. Our findings reveal a consistent negative association between accessibility and green cover implying a trade-off between access and greenery. We found large variations between European cities in the walking accessibility of schools, ranging from 44\% to 98\% of the population being within 1600 m of their school. Moreover, our results show substantial within-city disparities in travel greenery availability in large European cities. We demonstrated methodologically the importance of considering seasonal variations when measuring greenery availability. Our study offers empirical evidence of urban greenery availability from a mobility-focused perspective. It provides a novel understanding with which to support researchers and planners in affording the benefits of nature to more people as they travel.},

Shade from buildings can provide cooling and protection for pedestrians, but the extent of this potential benefit is unknown. Here we explore the potential for shaded walking, using building footprints and street networks from both synthetic and real cities. We introduce a route choice model with a sun avoidance parameter \$\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\$and define the CoolWalkability metric to measure opportunities for walking in shade. We derive analytically that on a regular grid with constant building heights, CoolWalkability is independent of \$\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\$, and that the grid provides no CoolWalkability benefit for shade-seeking individuals compared to the shortest path. However, variations in street geometry and building heights create such benefits. We further uncover that the potential for shaded routing differs between grid-like and irregular street networks, forms local clusters, and is sensitive to the mapped network geometry. Our research identifies the limitations and potential of shade for cool, active travel, and is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of shade provision for sustainable mobility in cities.},

  abstract = {After several decades, an increasing number of European cities have been experiencing population growth after a longer phase of decline. This new growth represents not just a quantitative phenomenon but also has qualitative implications for the urban space and the built environment. A juxtaposition of re- and de-densification, as well as changes in land use, in the form of a small-scale spatial mosaic, can be observed. A crucial factor for estimating the relationship between the built environment and demand for it is population density. Increasing population densities may put pressure on sustaining a certain quality of life and on ecological recovery spaces. In this vein, an indicator concept for re- and de-densification will be applied to the city of Leipzig, one of the most illustrative examples of a regrowing city, in order to shed light on the complex relationship between changing human housing demands and their impact on land use. The concept involves measuring population density. Our study has demonstrated that, although similar density changes can be observed in different periods in different parts of the city, they are dominated by different drivers, leading to the formation of different spatial patterns. The results of our study emphasise that regrowth should be understood as a distinctive process because it is distributed very heterogeneously within the city area, with a variety of spatial effects and impacts. The concept allows us to draw conclusions about processes that mitigate, drive or reinforce regrowth, and therefore contributes to a better understanding of this phenomenon and its implications for land use.},

  abstract = {At the beginning of the 21st century, the phenomenon of shrinking cities was widely discussed across Europe. Most European countries saw an increasingly ageing population and an internal migration from underdeveloped to more competitive locations. Since the turn of the century, and in contrast to the past, a great deal has been written about the causes and impacts of shrinkage, as well as about policies and planning strategies. However, the state of knowledge in a cross-national comparative perspective is rather poor because, to date, studies have basically analysed large cities and empirical evidence hardly shifts attention to the contextual influence on local dynamics. Against this background, this paper fills the gap between macrotheoretical conceptualisation and empirical observation by testing a heuristic model of urban shrinkage encompassing the whole range of cities in Europe. The paper questions to what extent urban shrinkage represents a broader trend in Europe in terms of both duration and distribution, and aims to investigate the influence of economic and demographic drivers on the non-linear evolution of shrinking cities in Europe. Thereby, the spatial distribution of different trajectories of shrinking cities in urban Europe in the period from 1990 to 2010 will be presented in a comprehensive survey which reveals that 20\% of European cities experienced shrinkage between 1990 and 2010, whereas 883 cities face recent shrinkage.},

For many decades, demographers have been struggling to explain this phenomenon. For various national and cultural reasons, the nation state is interested in devising ways and means of rectifying this steady decline. There appears to be an inverse quantitative relationship between birth rate and economic prosperity as depicted by per capita gross national income. This empirical correlation was found to exist in case-study countries with significantly different cultural values, viz. Finland and Singapore. The long-term decrease in natality was discovered to be strongly related to steadily rising economic prosperity in advanced economies. Reversing the gain in per capita gross national income could not be considered realistically within the pervasive neoliberal economic framework. In view of this finding, there may be no practicable solution to the problem of declining birth rates in advanced economies, notwithstanding any cultural-value differences. It could be speculated that emerging economies would experience declining natality as they become advanced economies.},

  abstract = {Wetlands are often acknowledged as a nature-based solution for improving flood resilience in a large river basin. However, the effects of wetlands on floods have not been assessed as extensively within a large river basin, as previous studies have mainly focused on assessing the effect on peak flows of a certain given return period. In this study, a distributed hydrological modeling platform was used to (i) quantify the effect of wetlands on floods with respect to event hydrographs, and (ii) investigate how flood regulation services can occur on the rising and falling limbs of an event hydrograph. Further, we hypothesized that flood resilience depends on the distribution and location of wetlands in the basin. The hydrological modeling study was conducted on a 297,000-km2 large river basin in Northeast China, where wetlands are abundant covering approximately 12\% of the basin area. Our modeling study show that wetlands can reduce peak and mean flows, event duration, and flow volume (i.e., runoff volume) by, respectively, 24\% (12.14~mm), 12\% (4.37~mm), 4\% (1~day), and 17\% (18~{\texttimes}~108{$\cdot$}m3) in this large river basin. The attenuation efficiency of these wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin, especially apparent on peak flow, mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb of a flood event. These findings highlight flood regulation services and attest that wetlands can exhibit different effects; that sometimes they may amplify flood conditions. Thus, wetlands are an important land cover for enhancing resilience to flood events within large river basins, and wetland protection and restoration ought to be important conservation measures.},

The inclusive design for renovated open spaces are seldom discussed. Using open spaces in Hong Kong and Guangzhou as case studies, this paper identifies barriers to and opportunities for the creation of inclusive open spaces in dense older districts. The paper proposes a framework with six key elements, namely accessibility, reliability, responsibility, flexibility, legibility and resonance, based on analysis of six categories of design and services. The results show that public participation is required during the different stages of planning, decision-making and evaluation. Finally, the paper provides some suggestions for researchers, urban planners as well as policymakers to consider how to improve the quality of open spaces in densely older districts.},

Under the new LaGD paradigm, the old datasets, which have led to advances in RSI intelligence understanding in the last decade, are no longer suitable for fire-new tasks. We argued that a new dataset must be designed to lighten tasks with the following features: 1) Generalization: training model to learn shared knowledge among tasks and to adapt to different tasks; 2) Understanding complex scenes: training model to understand the fine-grained attribute of the objects of interest, and to be able to describe the scene with natural language; 3) Reasoning: training model to be able to realize high-level visual reasoning. In this paper, we designed a high-quality, diversified, and unified multimodal instruction-following dataset for RSI understanding produced by GPT-4V and existing datasets, which we called RS-GPT4V. To achieve generalization, we used a (Question, Answer) which was deduced from GPT-4V via instruction-following to unify the tasks such as captioning and localization; To achieve complex scene, we proposed a hierarchical instruction description with local strategy in which the fine-grained attributes of the objects and their spatial relationships are described and global strategy in which all the local information are integrated to yield detailed instruction descript; To achieve reasoning, we designed multiple-turn QA pair to provide the reasoning ability for a model. The empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLMs by RS-GPT4V can describe fine-grained information. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/RS-GPT4V.},

  abstract = {Introduction: There is an interest in exploring the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual cognitive function; however, little is known about whether these relationships can be modified by individual socioeconomic status, such as educational attainment and income. Methods: Drawing from the 2010-2018 Health and Retirement Study, this study analyzed 10,621 older respondents (aged 65+) with a total of 33,931 person-waves. These respondents did not have dementia in 2010 and stayed in the same neighborhood throughout the study period. Cognitive function was measured with a 27-point indicator biennially, and neighborhood characteristics (i.e., walkability, concentrated disadvantage, and social isolation) were assessed in 2010. All analyses were performed in 2023. Results: Cognitive function is positively associated with neighborhood walkability and negatively related to concentrated disadvantage, suggesting that exposures to these neighborhood characteristics have long-lasting impacts on cognitive function. Furthermore, individual socioeconomic status modifies the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and cognitive function. Compared with those graduating from college, respondents without a bachelor's degree consistently have lower cognitive function but the educational gap in cognitive function narrows with increases in walkability (b= 0.152, SE=0.092), and widens when neighborhood concentrated disadvantage (b=0.212, SE=0.070) or social isolation (b=0.315, SE=0.125) rises. The income gap in cognitive function shrinks with increases in walkability (b= 0.063, SE=0.027). Conclusions: The moderating role of socioeconomic status indicates that low-socioeconomic status older adults who also live in disadvantaged neighborhoods face a higher risk of poor cognitive function. Low-education and low-income aging adults may have the most to gain from investments to improve neighborhood characteristics.},

Previous studies, however, have paid limited attention to the non-linear and synergistic effects of built environment factors. To this end, based on multi-source data such as the Travel Characteristic Survey of Hong Kong and Google Street View imagery, this study integrates two advanced machine learning models---light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)---to analyze the non-linear and synergistic effects of various built environment factors on older adults' walking time. The results show that the effect of the built environment is largely non-linear. Critical built environment factors include access to recreational facilities and land-use mix. Access to metro and parks, however, plays a marginal role in affecting older adults' walking. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of built environment variable pairs (e.g., access to recreational facilities and intersection density) are also identified.},

  abstract = {Population aging is a conspicuous demographic trend shaping the world profoundly. Walking is a critical travel mode and physical activity for older adults. As such, there is a need to determine the factors influencing the walking behavior of older people in the era of population aging. Streetscape greenery is an easily perceived built-environment attribute and can promote walking behavior, but it has received insufficient attention. More importantly, the non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking behavior of older adults have not been examined. We therefore use readily available Google Street View imagery and a fully convolutional neural network to evaluate human-scale, eye-level streetscape greenery. Using data from the Hong Kong Travel Characteristic Survey, we adopt a machine learning technique, namely random forest modeling, to scrutinize the non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking propensity of older adults. The results show that streetscape greenery has a positive effect on walking propensity within a certain range, but outside the range, the positive association no longer holds. The non-linear associations of other built-environment attributes are also examined.},

Whether the distribution of human perceptions in continuous city space shows specific characteristics and how to disclose these phenomena remains a direction worth exploring. Due to cities' heterogeneity, quantitatively identifying the homogeneous perception regions at a fine scale within large urban regions is challenging. This study proposed a novel method to discover the homogeneous geographic domain of human perception using massive street view images. First, human perceptions of the urban visual environment were evaluated using street view images. Next, perception network models were constructed based on the road network and perception assessment results. Then, the Infomap community detection algorithm was used to identify homogeneous human perception communities. The qualitative and quantitative results verified our approach's effectiveness for capturing human perceptions' homogeneous geographic domain. Moreover, driving factor analysis was conducted to determine the urban function that may cause a community to be perceived differently based on point-of-interest (POI) data. In general, our method for combining human perceptions and the topology of urban roads could identify the homogeneous perception domain, which is valuable for urban structure studies and human perception assessment.},

  abstract = {To infer unknown remote sensing scenarios, most existing technologies use a supervised learning paradigm to train deep neural network (DNN) models on closed datasets. This paradigm faces challenges such as highly spatiotemporal variants and ever-changing scale-heterogeneous remote sensing scenarios. Additionally, DNN models cannot scale to new scenarios. Lifelong learning is an effective solution to these problems. Current lifelong learning approaches focus on overcoming the catastrophic forgetting issue (i.e., a successive increase in heterogeneous remote sensing scenes causes models to forget historical scenes) while ignoring the knowledge recall issue (i.e., how to facilitate the learning of new scenes by recalling historical experiences), which is a significant problem. This article proposes a lifelong learning framework called asymmetric collaborative network (SCN) for lifelong remote sensing image (RSI) classification. This framework consists of two structurally distinct networks: a preserving network (Pres-Net) and a transient network (Trans-Net), which imitate the long- and short-term memory processes in the brain, respectively. Moreover, this framework is based on two synergistic knowledge transfer mechanisms: triple distillation and prior feature fusion. The triple distillation mechanism enables knowledge persistence from Trans-Net to Pres-Net to achieve better memorization; the prior feature fusion mechanism enables knowledge transfer from Pres-Net to Trans-Net to achieve better recall. Experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCN for three-, six-, and nine-task-length learning. The idea of asymmetric separation networks and the synergistic strategy proposed in this article are expected to provide new solutions to the translatability of the classification of RSIs in real-world scenarios.

This paper addresses this gap and employs a novel, open and reproducible urban analytics approach to systematically examine the past and future trajectories of neighbourhood change using London, England, as a case-study example. Using suites of datasets relating to population, house prices, and built environment development, the nature of gentrification's mutations and its spatial patterns are extracted through a multi-stage data dimensionality reduction and classification methodology. Machine learning is subsequently adopted to model gentrification's observed trends and predict its future frontiers with interactive visualisation methods offering new insights into gentrification's projected dynamics and geographies.},

While urban scenes in UAV image characteristic by large scale variation of objects size and complexity background, which posed challenges to urban scenes segmentation of UAV image. The feature extracting backbone of existing networks cannot extract complex features of UAV image effectively, which limits the performance of urban scenes segmentation. To design segmentation network capable of extracting features of large scale variation urban ground scenes, this study proposed a novel composite transformer network for urban scenes segmentation of UAV image. A composite backbone with aggregation windows multi-head self-attention transformer blocks is proposed to make the extracted features more representatives by adaptive multi-level features fusion, and the full utilisation of contextual information and local information. Position attention modules are inserted in each stage between encoder and decoder to further enhance the spatial attention of extracted feature maps. Finally, a V-shaped decoder which is capable of utilising multi-level features is designed to get accurately dense prediction. The accuracy of urban scenes segmentation could significantly be enhanced in this way and successfully segmented the large scale variation objects from UAV views. Extensive ablation experiments and comparative experiments for the proposed network have been conducted on the public available urban scenes segmentation datasets for UAV imagery. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of designed network structure and the superiority of proposed network over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, reached 53.2\% mIoU on the UAVid dataset and 77.6\% mIoU on the UDD6 dataset, respectively. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors.},

  abstract = {Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) models have experienced a surge in popularity recently. By fine-tuning them on specific datasets, significant performance improvements have been observed in various tasks. However, full fine-tuning of VLP models not only consumes a significant amount of computational resources but also has a significant environmental impact. Moreover, as remote sensing (RS) data are constantly being updated, full fine-tuning may not be practical for real-world applications. To address this issue, in this work, we investigate the parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) method to effectively and efficiently transfer visual--language knowledge from the natural domain to the RS domain on the image--text retrieval task. To this end, we make the following contributions. First, we construct a novel and sophisticated PETL framework for the RS image--text retrieval (RSITR) task, which includes the pretrained CLIP model, a multimodal RS adapter, and a hybrid multimodal contrastive (HMMC) learning objective. Second, to deal with the problem of high intramodal similarity in RS data, we design a simple yet effective HMMC loss. Third, we provide comprehensive empirical studies for PETL-based RSITR (PE-RSITR). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising and of great potential for practical applications. Fourth, we benchmark extensive state-of-the-art (SOTA) PETL methods on the RSITR task. Our proposed model only contains 0.16 M training parameters, which can achieve a parameter reduction of 98.9\% compared with full fine-tuning, resulting in substantial savings in training costs. Our retrieval performance exceeds traditional methods by 7\%--13\% and achieves comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning. This work can provide new ideas and useful insights for RS vision--language (VL) tasks.},

  abstract = {Built environment neighborhood characteristics are difficult to measure and assess on a large scale. Consequently, there is a lack of sufficient data that can help us investigate neighborhood characteristics as structural determinants of health on a national level. The objective of this study is to utilize publicly available Google Street View images as a data source for characterizing built environments and to examine the influence of built environments on chronic diseases and health behaviors in the United States. Data were collected by processing 164 million Google Street View images from November 2019 across the United States. Convolutional Neural Networks, a class of multi-layer deep neural networks, were used to extract features of the built environment. Validation analyses found accuracies of 82\% or higher across neighborhood characteristics. In regression analyses controlling for census tract sociodemographics, we find that single-lane roads (an indicator of lower urban development) were linked with chronic conditions and worse mental health. Walkability and urbanicity indicators such as crosswalks, sidewalks, and two or more cars were associated with better health, including reduction in depression, obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Street signs and streetlights were also found to be associated with decreased chronic conditions. Chain link fence (physical disorder indicator) was generally associated with poorer mental health. Living in neighborhoods with a built environment that supports social interaction and physical activity can lead to positive health outcomes. Computer vision models using manually annotated Google Street View images as a training dataset were able to accurately identify neighborhood built environment characteristics. These methods increases the feasibility, scale, and efficiency of neighborhood studies on health.},

Seventy peer-reviewed journal articles which met the selection criteria were examined. Research designs were summarized by geographical location and the associations of environmental characteristics and walking were calculated. Interactions between moderators and environmental characteristics for all types of walking were also categorized. Results have shown that transport walking is the most supported by neighborhood environmental characteristics. The positively related environmental characteristics are walkability, urbanization, land use mix-diversity and accessibility, walking amenities, and bicycle lanes. Total walking was positively associated with walkability and urbanization. Recreational walking was associated with neighborhood employment/income level, nearness to public transport/bus stops, and social cohesion. The most commonly used moderators were age and gender, but inconsistent moderating effects between neighborhood environments and walking were also found. In densely populated environments such as Hong Kong, older adults walked mostly for both transport and recreation. In contrast, American older adults in low density areas walked less for transport and more for recreation. Findings support a strong relationship between neighborhood environments and older adults' walking. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and comparison studies by geographic location.},

The SDT predicts unilinear change toward very low fertility and a diversity of union and family types. The primary driver of these changes is a powerful, inevitable and irreversible shift in attitudes and norms in the direction of greater individual freedom and self-actualization. First, we describe the origin of this framework and its evolution over time. Second, we review the empirical fit of the framework to major changes in demographic and family behavior in the U.S., the West, and beyond. As has been the case for other unilinear, developmental theories of demographic/family change, the SDT failed to predict many contemporary patterns of change/difference. Finally, we review previous critiques and identify fundamental weaknesses of this perspective, and provide brief comparisons to selected alternative approaches.},

Existing studies have proven that the built environment plays a significant role in human health, but little attention is paid to the elderly in this regard. At the same time, existing studies are mainly concentrated in Western developed countries, and there are few empirical studies in developing countries such as China. Based on POI (point of interest) data and 882 questionnaires collected from 20 neighborhoods in Guangzhou, we employ multilevel linear regression modeling, mediating effect modeling, to explore the path and mechanism of the impact of the built environment on elderly individuals' physical health, especially the mediating effects of physical and social interaction activity. The results show that the number of POIs, the distance to the nearest park and square, and the number of parks and squares are significantly positively correlated with the physical health of the elderly, while the number of bus and subway stations and the distance to the nearest station are significantly negatively correlated. Secondly, physical activity and social networks play a separate role in mediating the effect of the built environment on elderly individuals' physical health. The results enrich the research on the built environment and elderly individuals' health in the context of high-density cities in China and provide some reference basis for actively promoting spatial intervention and cultivating a healthy aging society.},

  abstract = {On 12 May 2008 the magnitude 8.0 Wenchuan Earthquake erupted on the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau in China, triggering many landslides onto towns and villages, leading to substantial loss of life and damage to property and the infrastructure. Local characteristic cloudy weather posed serious difficulties upon regional remote observation for disaster rescue in the mountainous region. To overcome weather limits to remote sensing, the study advanced one quick methodology to extract primary regional landslides with 8-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and terrain slope information. The threshold of temporal NDVI jump (value of 0.4) was introduced to discriminate landslide induced sharp NDVI decline from seasonal variations of vegetation cover, while slope information can be used to further confirm land cover change caused by a landslide. The study indicated that the Wenchuan Earthquake induced about 170 km2 of landslides in the southern half of the Longmenshan Fault Zone, most of which was formerly covered by forest or shrub. An ecological restoration of the areas affected by landslides will therefore be quite difficult. In addition, the result emphasizes that regions with slopes over 15{$^\circ$} are exposed to high landslide risk, which should be carefully taken into account for settlement and transportation planning.},

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics.},

By applying a natural language processing model to 17,243 noise complaint records, we uncovered distinct patterns of traffic, industrial, and living noise exposures across residential communities. Our analysis of street view images near complaint locations, utilizing a Residual Network (ResNet) model and Class Activation Mapping (CAM), identified the key environmental elements of different noise sources. Notably, our assessment of noise exposure inequality across 9791 communities yielded a counterintuitive finding: contrary to previous studies in Western contexts, rich communities in China experience higher and more unequal noise exposure compared to average communities, with Gini coefficients exceeding 0.8. This unexpected result likely stems from China's unique rapid urbanization process. Our use of crowdsourced complaint data aligns more closely with human subjective perceptions of noise, offering a novel perspective on noise exposure inequality. These findings challenge existing assumptions about the relationship between socioeconomic status and environmental quality in urban China, and have significant implications for urban planning and noise management strategies in rapidly developing cities.},

As a result, spatial information is often not used effectively. This paper uses image-based neural networks to explore the relationship between urban spatial risk and the distribution of infected populations, and the design of urban facilities. To achieve this objective, we use spatio-temporal data of people infected with new coronary pneumonia prior to 28 February 2020 in Wuhan. We then use kriging, which is a method of spatial interpolation, as well as core density estimation technology to establish the epidemic heat distribution on fine grid units. We further evaluate the influence of nine major spatial risk factors, including the distribution of agencies, hospitals, park squares, sports fields, banks and hotels, by testing them for significant positive correlation with the distribution of the epidemic. The weights of these spatial risk factors are used for training Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models, which predict the distribution of cases in a given area. The input image for the machine learning model is a city plan converted by public infrastructures, and the output image is a map of urban spatial risk factors in the given area. The results of the trained model demonstrate that optimising the relevant point of interests (POI) in urban areas to effectively control potential risk factors can aid in managing the epidemic and preventing it from dispersing further.},

Methods Recurrent AMI was identified by the Beijing Monitoring System for Cardiovascular Diseases through the end of 2019 for patients discharged with AMI between 2007 and 2017. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to estimate associations between neighborhood disorder and AMI recurrence. Results Of 66,238 AMI patients, 11,872 had a recurrent event, and 3117 died from AMI during a median follow-up of 5.92~years. After covariate adjustment, AMI patients living in the high tertile of neighborhood disorder had a higher recurrence risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95~\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03--1.14) compared with those in the low tertile. A stronger association was noted for fatal recurrent AMI (HR 1.21, 95~\% CI 1.10--1.34). The association was mainly observed in females (HR 1.04, 95~\% CI: 1.02 to 1.06). Conclusions Serious neighborhood disorder may contribute to higher recurrence risk, particularly fatal recurrence, among AMI patients.

  abstract = {Introduction: There is an emerging imperative to design walkable communities catering to older adults, particularly given the context of an increasingly aging population. However, studies of how older citizens perceive walkability remain scarce. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that influence walking behaviours and perceived walkability among senior citizens, whilst also illuminating the associations between them. Methods: A quantitative analysis was conducted on 200 older individuals living in Ealing, London, an area with a large proportion of senior citizens. Utilising the self-developed Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale for Older Adults (NEWS-OA), based on the abbreviated version of NEWS, both linear and logistic regression models were employed to decode the data. Results: Our results show that NEWS-OA is appropriate for assessing perceived walkability among senior citizens and reveal concerns regarding traffic safety. Communities with high walkability are likely to encourage an extended distance, duration, and frequency of walks. However, socioeconomic status (SES) was found to have a less pronounced effect on walking frequency and distance. The study further demonstrates that perceptions of safety were lower among older adults with a high SES. We found that positive perceptions of all the variables tested, except Aesthetics, encouraged walking. Furthermore, the study reveals the crucial influence of these perceptions on older adults' inclination to walk for various purposes, such as the role of perceived safety in terms of social interaction. Conclusions: This study offers insights that can be used to make London a more age-friendly and walkable city. It can also serve as a reference for other cities to enhance inclusiveness.},

Inspired by this, we propose a novel adversarial style augmentation (AdvStyle) approach, which can dynamically generate hard stylized images during training and thus can effectively prevent the model from overfitting on the source domain. Specifically, AdvStyle regards the style feature as a learnable parameter and updates it by adversarial training. The learned adversarial style feature is used to construct an adversarial image for robust model training. AdvStyle is easy to implement and can be readily applied to different models. Experiments on two synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that AdvStyle can significantly improve the model performance on unseen real domains and show that we can achieve the state of the art. Moreover, AdvStyle can be employed to domain generalized image classification and produces a clear improvement on the considered datasets.},

  abstract = {It is of great significance both in theory and in practice to propose an efficient approach to approximating visual walkability given urban residents' growing leisure needs. Recent advancements in sensing and computing technologies provide new opportunities in this regard. This paper first proposes a conceptual framework for understanding street visual walkability and then employs deep learning technologies to segment and extract physical features from Baidu Map Street View (BMSV) imagery using the case of Shenzhen City in China. Guided by this framework, four indicators are calculated based on the segmented imagery and further integrated into the visual walkability index (VWI), whose reliability is validated through manual interpretation and a subjective scoring experiment. Our results show that deep learning technologies achieve higher accuracy in segmenting street view imagery than the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and support vector machine algorithm. Moreover, the developed VWI is effective to measure visual walkability, and it presents great heterogeneity across streets within Shenzhen. Spatial regression further identifies that significant social inequalities are associated with neighborhood visual walkability. According to the findings, implications and suggestions on planning the healthy city are proposed. The methodological procedure is reduplicative and can be applied to other unfeasible or challenging cases.},

  abstract = {Towards a safe and comfortable driving, road scene segmentation is a rudimentary problem in camera-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Despite of the great achievement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation task, the high computational efforts of CNNbased methods is still a challenging area. In recent work, we proposed a novel approach to utilize the advantages of CNN's for the task of road segmentation at reasonable computational effort. The runtime benefits from using irregular superpixels as basis for the input for the CNN rather than the image grid, which tremendously reduces the input size. Although, this method achieved remarkable low computational time in both training and testing phases, the lower resolution of the superpixel domain yields naturally lower accuracy compared to high cost state of the art methods. In this work, we focus on an refinement of the road segmentation utilizing a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The refinement procedure is limited to the superpixels touching the predicted road boundary to keep the additional computational effort low. Reducing the input to the super-pixel domain allows the CNN's structure to stay small and efficient to compute while keeping the advantage of convolutional layers and makes them eligible for ADAS. Applying CRF compensates the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed system obtains comparable performance among the top-performing algorithms on the KITTI road benchmark and it's fast inference makes it particularly suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood design affects lifestyle physical activity, and ultimately human wellbeing. There are, however, a limited number of studies that examine neighborhood design types. In this research, we examine four types of neighborhood designs: traditional development, suburban development, enclosed community, and cluster housing development, and assess their level of walkability and their effects on physical activity and wellbeing. We examine significant associations through a questionnaire (n = 486) distributed in Tucson, Arizona using the Walkability Model. Among the tested neighborhood design types, traditional development showed significant associations and the highest value for walkability, as well as for each of the two types of walking (recreation and transportation) representing physical activity. Suburban development showed significant associations and the highest mean values for mental health and wellbeing. Cluster housing showed significant associations and the highest mean value for social interactions with neighbors and for perceived safety from crime. Enclosed community did not obtain the highest means for any wellbeing benefit. The Walkability Model proved useful in identifying the walkability categories associated with physical activity and perceived crime. For example, the experience category was strongly and inversely associated with perceived crime. This study provides empirical evidence of the importance of including vegetation, particularly trees, throughout neighborhoods in order to increase physical activity and wellbeing. Likewise, the results suggest that regular maintenance is an important strategy to improve mental health and overall wellbeing in cities.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed noticeable demographic changes around the world. The global population has continued to increase steadily and, according to forecasts, the trend will be maintained in the coming decades. An increase in the 60+ population is yet another important demographic change. These determinants pose new challenges for socio-economic, spatial, and transport policies in most, if not all, cities in the world. These policies should be aligned with the global development paradigm to promote sustainable development and sustainable improvement of the quality of life of the present and future generations. In the coming years, the potential of cities should be recognized, resources should be managed rationally, effective spatial policies should be implemented, and user-friendly spaces should be created to promote the development of effectively managed urban areas. Cities are often compared to living organisms, which is why social mobility is a crucial determinant of urban development and is often used in assessments of cities. To address the above needs, a universal and innovative methodology for assessing the age-friendly walkability (AFW) of urban public spaces was developed and tested in the present study. The methodology was developed based on a review of the current trends in age-friendly cities, a survey of the target population, and a self-designed concept for evaluating the walkability of pedestrian routes in public space. The proposed methodology not only contributes to the existing knowledge but also has practical implications because it was tested in a Polish city to classify the 15 minute walkability of pedestrian routes and to identify Strategic Intervention Areas for the 60+ population (SAI 60+). This innovative approach to walkable urban public spaces is a simple tool for developing senior-friendly planning solutions in cities. The developed paper constitutes a basis for precise spatial planning it is based on reliable data by conducting a full and comprehensive spatial inventory of mobility trajectories of older people walkability. The aim of the undertaken research was to improve the quality of urban residents' lives in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (to make cities and human settlements safe, stable, and sustainable). Above all, the study is congruous with the sustainable urban mobility vision.},
